May 20, 2024—Security Playbooks now includes Risk Event Response playbooks, a new feature designed to help you respond to new and ongoing risk events detected in your environment. You can set up the playbooks to respond to or send notifications about the risk events associated with all risk factors identified in Threat and Exposure Management, with the exception of XDR detection. For XDR detection related risk events, configure Automated Response Playbooks to enable automatic actions in response to high-priority alerts in Workbench.

For more information, see [Create Risk Event Response playbooks](creating-risk-reduction-playbooks.mdx).
