::: {role="main"}
With one of the largest domain-reputation databases in the world, Trend Micro web reputation technology tracks the credibility of web domains by assigning a reputation score based on factors including website's age, historical location changes and indications of suspicious activities discovered through malware behavior analysis, such as phishing attacks that are designed to trick users into providing personal information. To increase accuracy and reduce false positives, Trend Micro Web Reputation Services assigns reputation scores to specific pages or links within sites instead of classifying or blocking entire sites, since often, only portions of legitimate sites are hacked and reputations can change dynamically over time.

Attackers may use phishing websites that disguise as legitimate websites to steal user credentials that provide access to your network. To enhance its capability of spotting these credential phishing websites, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection integrates with dynamic URL scanning and applies it to URLs such as those classified as Untested by Trend Micro Web Reputation Services. By crawling the web pages of these URLs in real time, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection determines whether the pages contain malicious patterns and takes pre-configured actions to keep users from zero-day phishing attacks.

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also leverages artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer vision to protect cloud service users against credential phishing attacks. It uses this advanced technology to recognize key elements of a valid cloud service logon page to help prevent users from submitting credentials to untrusted sites and help them get rid of account compromise.

In this release, for a URL detected as a credential phish, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection takes the action configured by the administrator under **Action** on this URL.

## Web Reputation risk levels {#web-reputation-risk-levels}

The following table explains the Web Reputation risk levels. View the table to understand why a URL is classified as dangerous, highly suspicious, or suspicious.

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Dangerous</p></td>
<td><p>The URL is verified to be fraudulent or known sources of threats.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Suspicious</p></td>
<td><p>The URL is associated with spam or possibly compromised.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Untested</p></td>
<td><p>The URL has not been tested by Trend Micro yet. While Trend Micro actively tests web pages for safety, users may encounter untested pages when visiting new or less popular websites. Blocking access to untested pages can improve safety but can also prevent access to safe pages.</p></td>

    3.  Click **Add**.

        The specified entry appears in the area below.

        When the specified header field of an email message contains or exactly matches with the specified value depending on whether **Contains** or **Equals** is selected, the message will not be scanned by Web Reputation for malicious and suspicious URL detection, but will still go through the other security filters in the policy.

        :::note

        Be aware that **Name** and **Value** are case sensitive, and wildcard characters and regular expressions are not supported.

        The header field name and value cannot exceed 128 characters.
        :::

    4.  Optionally repeat steps **b** and **c** to add another header field as necessary.

        The email message whose header field hits any of the specified entries will not be scanned by Web Reputation.

        :::note

        Be aware that regular expressions are not supported.

        For URLs without query parameters, wildcard characters only in the `*.example.com` and `*.example.com/example/*` formats are supported.
        :::

    3.  Optionally click **Import** to import URLs in batches.

    4.  Optionally click **Export** to export URLs in batches.

9.  Click **Action & Notifications**.

10. Configure **Action** settings.

    Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection protects services by executing specified actions on email messages or files that match scanning conditions.

    For details about the actions, see [Actions available for different services](actions-different-services.mdx).

    1.  Optionally select the **Take action on URLs that have not been tested by Trend Micro Web Reputation Services** check box to apply the configured action to the URLs not yet tested by Trend Micro, for example, new born URLs or shortened URLs.

        :::

    3.  If the **Tag file name** action is selected, specify the tag to append to the file name.

        :::note

        The tag cannot exceed 20 characters or contain unsupported characters (/ \\ : \* ? &lt; &gt; " |).
