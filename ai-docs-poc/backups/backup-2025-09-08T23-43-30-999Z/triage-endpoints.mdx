::: {role="main"}
Use **Forensics** to identify, prioritize, and manage attacked endpoints based on the severity and impact.

You can collect detailed evidence from potentially compromised endpoints for internal investigations into critical incidents that occurred on your network and may require further attention.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Agentic SIEM & XDR â†’ Forensics**.

2.  Click the name of the workspace that has the endpoints you want to triage.

3.  Select one or more endpoints from the list. Selected endpoints must all use the same operating system.

4.  Use one of the available options for triage:

    - [Run YARA Rules](run-yara-rules-task.mdx)

    - [Run osquery](run-osquery-task.mdx)

    The task you selected starts running

5.  After the task you executed finishes running, click **View Query Results** to see the results.

6.  Analyze the results to decide further actions.
