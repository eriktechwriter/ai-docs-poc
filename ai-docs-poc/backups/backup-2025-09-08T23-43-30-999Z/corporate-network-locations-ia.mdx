Manage Internet Access gateways and corporate network locations to monitor, analyze, and control web activities on known locations, such as the corporate headquarters, a branch office, or company VPN.

In addition to the Cloud Gateway, Internet Access also provides a flexible option to deploy one or more local on-premises gateways in your organization's network as a hybrid protection solution.

The **Gateways** tab in the **Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration** screen allows you to manage Internet Access Cloud and On-Premises Gateways to identify your corporate network locations.

- Internet Access Cloud Gateway: Specify the externally-facing IP addresses of your organization's internet gateways and register the IP addresses to the Internet Access Cloud Gateway.

- Internet Access On-Premises Gateway: Deploy a Service Gateway virtual appliance and enable the Zero Trust Internet Access On-Premises Gateway service to indicate the corporate locations managed by each server.

:::tip

- Trend Vision One can inspect HTTPS/HTTP traffic forwarded to an Internet Access Gateway (such as the Cloud Gateway) from corporate network locations to determine whether users are allowed to visit cloud apps or external URLs based on applied secure access rules.

- The Internet Access Cloud Gateway also controls HTTPS/HTTP traffic when users are accessing from outside your corporate locations, such as users connecting to public Wi-Fi networks or working from home.

The following table outlines the actions and information available in the **Cloud Gateway** section on the **Gateways** tab.

:::warning[Important]

<p>This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the <a href="trend-vision-one-pre-release-disclaimer">Pre-release disclaimer</a> before using the feature.</p>


:::


<ul>
<li><p><strong>ON</strong> (default): User authentication is always required, whether HTTP/HTTPS requests are forwarded through <a href="trend-vision-one-iac-secure-access-module">client access or traffic forwarding</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Client Access only</strong>: User authentication is required only when HTTP/HTTPS requests are forwarded through client access.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Users are always required to authenticate themselves when the traffic is forwarded via client access. Unlike client access, user authentication is configurable when the traffic is forwarded via traffic forwarding (using PAC files, proxy chaining, or port forwarding).</p>
<p>Disable user authentication for traffic forwarding, for example, if you want the gateway to enforce internet access rules on devices that directly connect to the gateway and have no specific users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Last communication</strong>: The most recent time when the Zero Trust Internet Access On-Premises Gateway service communicated with Internet Access</p></li>
