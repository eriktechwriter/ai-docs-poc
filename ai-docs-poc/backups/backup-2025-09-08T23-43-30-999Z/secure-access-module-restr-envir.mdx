:::: {role="main"}
In a restricted network environment, direct internet access is blocked. Users can only access the internet via a proxy or a Service Gateway.

The Zero Trust Secure Access Module supports connecting to Trend Vision One through either a proxy or a Service Gateway with Forward Proxy Service enabled.

The Zero Trust Secure Access Module uses the proxy or Service Gateway for management traffic, including:

- Fetch configurations, the PAC file, and updates from Trend Vision One
- Sign in to Trend Vision One. (excluding [NTLM single sign-on for Internet Access](ntlm-single-sign-internet-access.mdx))
- Other communications with Trend Vision One.

:::warning[Important]

This feature is supported only on Windows and requires Zero Trust Secure Access Module version 2.22 or later

    :::warning[Important]

    Do not add a Zero Trust Internet Access On-Premises Gateway or Cloud Gateway to Primary Custom Proxy Settings in Runtime Proxy Settings. Zero Trust Internet Access On-Premises Gateway is exclusively for Zero Trust Internet Access and should not be used as a general proxy server. To use your existing Service Gateway as a general proxy server, install the Forward Proxy Service on your Service Gateway.

    For more information, see [Service Gateway services](service-gateway-services.mdx) .
    :::

    :::note

    To use a Service Gateway for traffic forwarding, refer to [Getting started with Service Gateway](getting-started-service-gateway.mdx) to deploy a Service Gateway with Forward Proxy Service enabled.
