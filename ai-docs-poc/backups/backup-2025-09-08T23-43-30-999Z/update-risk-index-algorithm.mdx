:::: {role="main"}
June 5, 2023—Risk Insights has applied a significant update to the Risk Index algorithm for all customers. The algorithm now places a greater importance on Attack Detection. Periodic algorithm updates are part of our continuous effort to optimize the risk algorithm to provide you with an accurate, timely, and actionable Risk Index.

:::warning[Important]

Algorithm updates can result in a sudden and significant increase to asset risk scores and the Risk Index. A sharp increase in the Risk Index that directly coincides with an algorithm update can be considered the result of the algorithm change.
