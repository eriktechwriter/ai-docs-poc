October 13, 2023—You can now remove sensor only endpoints from Endpoint Inventory by selecting applicable endpoints and clicking the **Remove Endpoint** button. Removing a sensor only endpoint does not uninstall the Trend Vision One agent from the endpoint or stop the agent program sending information to Trend Vision One. Support for removing Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection agents from the Endpoint Inventory screen is under development.
