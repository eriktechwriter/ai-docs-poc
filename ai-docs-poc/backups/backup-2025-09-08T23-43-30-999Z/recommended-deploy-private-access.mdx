You have 2 independent VLANs. How do you deploy Private Access?

To manage access permissions for your applications, it is essential to [creating Private Access Rules](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-vision-one-creating-pac-rule).

### Scenario {#scenario}

Your company operates with two independent VLANs that cannot communicate with each other and are not accessible from outside their respective networks. Each VLAN hosts several internal services. Two employees, who are outside the networks, are attempting to access these services.

**Your VLANs and internal services**

<table>
<thead style="text-align: left;">
<tr>
<th><p>VLAN</p></th>
<th><p>Internal Service</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody style="text-align: left;">
<tr>
<td><p>VLAN_1</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Service_1</li>
<li>Service_2</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>VLAN_2</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Service_3</li>
<li>Service_4</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Deploy Connector group {#deploy-connector-group}

First, you [create a connector group and deploy the connector](private-access-connector-deployment.mdx). The connector group serves to expose the VLANs, allowing external users to access the internal services hosted within them.

Since you have 2 independent VLANS, you must deploy 2 connectors â€” one in VLAN_1 and one in VLAN_2.

### Create internal application {#create-internal-application}

After deploying the connector, it is essential to [add the internal applications](add-internal-application-pac.mdx) in the Trend Vision One console to enable the connector to identify which applications it can access on the internal network.

Since you have 4 services for user access, you need to create 4 internal applications corresponding to these services.

In this scenario, when adding `Service_1` and `Service_2` as internal applications, both services should be assigned to `Connector Group 1`, as this connector group is deployed in the same VLAN as the services. Conversely, `Service_3` and `Service_4` should be assigned to `Connector Group 2`

:::note

Now we are setting up the Internal Applications, users will be able to access these applications through devices equipped with the Secure Access Module. However, access to certain internal applications is restricted to users with permanent permissions.

Additionally, the default rule, titled `Default Rule for Internal App Access`, blocks all users from accessing internal applications.

### Create Private Access rule {#create-private-access-rule}

To manage access permissions for the applications we just created, it is essential to [create private access rules](creating-pac-rule.mdx).

For example, Services 1 and 2 can allow both Employee A and Employee B to access them. However, Service 3 is restricted to Employee A, while Service 4 is accessible only to Employee B.

<table>
<thead style="text-align: left;">
<tr>
<th><p>VLAN</p></th>
<th></th>
<th><p>Accessible by</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody style="text-align: left;">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2"><p>VLAN_1</p></td>
<td><p>Service_1</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Employee A</li>
<li>Employee B</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Service_2</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Employee A</li>
<li>Employee B</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2"><p>VLAN_2</p></td>
<td><p>Service_3</p></td>
<td><p>Employee A</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Service_4</p></td>
<td><p>Employee B</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We then create 2 private access rules Rule Allow A and Rule Allow B for these users:

- Rule Allow A : This rule grants Employee A access to the services 1, 2 and 3.
  - Selected Users / User Groups: Employee A
  - Selected Apps: Services 1, 2, and 3
  - Action: Allow Internal App Access
- Rule Allow B : This rule grants Employee B access to the services 1, 2 and 4:
  - Selected Users / User Groups: Employee B
  - Selected Apps: Services 1, 2, and 4
  - Action: Allow Internal App Access

Since the default rule already blocks access. Therefore, Employee A will still be unable to access Service 4, and Employee B will still be unable to access Service 3.
