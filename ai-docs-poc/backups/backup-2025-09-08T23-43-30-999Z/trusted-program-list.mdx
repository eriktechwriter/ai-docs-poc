You can configure Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents to skip scanning of trusted processes during Application Control, Behavior Monitoring, Device Control, Endpoint Sensor, and Real-time Scans. After adding a program to the Trusted Programs List, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent does not subject the program or any processes initiated by the program to Real-time Scan. Add trusted programs to the Trusted Program List to improve the performance of scanning on endpoints.

:::note

You can add a file to the Trusted Programs List if the file has a valid digital signature.
:::

After adding a program to the Trusted Programs List, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent automatically excludes the program from the following scans:

- Application Control (configurable only on the Trend Micro Apex Central console)

- Behavior Monitoring

- Device Control

- Endpoint Sensor (configurable only on the Trend Micro Apex Central console)

- Real-time Scan: file checking and process scanning
