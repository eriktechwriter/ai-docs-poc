:::warning[Important]

- **Permanent update**: You cannot undo or stop the update once you begin. The update may take some time to complete depending on the number of agents managed by your Endpoint & Workload Security instance. Trend Micro strongly recommends scheduling the update during off hours to avoid a disruption of service.

- **Forced sign out during update**: Communicate with any associates that access to your Trend Micro solutions (both Trend Vision One and Endpoint & Workload Security) will be immediately terminated once the update process begins. Finish all on-going tasks before starting the update. After the update completes, you may need to update your user accounts before re-accessing the system. If an account update is required, the affected users will receive an email notification with instructions about how to perform the update.

- **Post-update tasks**:

  - Verify that your user accounts have the correct access permissions and roles in the new User Account app and resolve any role conflicts.

  - Verify that all your endpoint groups, policies, and system settings updated properly to the Server & Workload Protection and Endpoint Inventory apps.

  - Check or establish your IdP connection in Trend Vision One.

  - The update process only moves your base agents and not your Endpoint Sensor agents. After the update process is complete, you must contact your support representative to re-associate your Endpoint Sensor agents with your Server & Workload Protection endpoints.

- **Activity Monitoring**: Enabling Endpoint sensor detection and response on your updated endpoints automatically disables Activity Monitoring on your endpoints. When updating to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security, your agents automatically adopt the **Default Endpoint Policy**. By default, Endpoint sensor detection and response is disabled to prevent accidental over-billing during the update process. For more information, see [Automatic disabling of Activity Monitoring after updating to Server & Workload Protection](auto-disable-activity-monitoring.mdx).

- **Compliance considerations**: Ensure that you have read and understood the [Privacy and personal data collection disclosure](ppdcd-trend-vision-one.mdx) for Trend Vision One. Customers that have PCI compliance concerns should contact a sales representative before starting the update.

- **AWS Marketplace billing policy**: If your Trend Cloud One account is charged through AWS Marketplace, your Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security instance continues to bill to AWS Marketplace after updating to Trend Vision One, while other paid features require credit allocation. Ensure that you have read and understood [Migrating a Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security instance billed to AWS Marketplace](migrate-billed-aws-market.mdx) before starting the update.
