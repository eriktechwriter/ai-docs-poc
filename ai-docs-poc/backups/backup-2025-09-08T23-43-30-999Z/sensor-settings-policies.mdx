Create and configure policies to centrally manage endpoint agent settings.

:::warning[Important]

- The first time you access the **Endpoint Security Policies** screen, the system imports your sensor settings from Endpoint Inventory to create several general policies along with the Default Endpoint Policy. For more information, see [About endpoint security policies](about-endpoint-security-policies.mdx).

  You might also see a message about the Network Content Inspection Engine feature. For more information, see [Network Content Inspection Engine for Endpoint Sensor](network-content-inspection-engine.mdx).

- Endpoint security policies only support endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent version October 2024 release or later installed.
:::

Use the **Endpoint Security Policies** screen (**Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Endpoint Security Policies**) to create policies which enable you to manage settings for your deployed Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent, including enabling endpoint detection and response. For detailed information about what endpoint security policies manage, see [About endpoint security policies](about-endpoint-security-policies.mdx).

The following table details the actions you can take on the Endpoint Security Policies screen:
