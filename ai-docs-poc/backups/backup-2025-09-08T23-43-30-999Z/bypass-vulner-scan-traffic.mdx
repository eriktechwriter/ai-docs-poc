If you are using a vulnerability management provider such as Qualys or Nessus (for PCI compliance, for example), you need to set up Server & Workload Protection to bypass or allow this provider’s scan traffic through untouched.

- Create a new IP list from the vulnerability scan provider IP range or addresses
- Create firewall rules for incoming and outbound scan traffic
- Assign the new firewall rules to a policy to bypass vulnerability scans

After these firewall rules have been assigned to the new policy, Server & Workload Protection will ignore ANY traffic from the IPs you have added in your IP List.

Server & Workload Protection will not scan the vulnerability management provider traffic for stateful issues or vulnerabilities - it will be allowed through untouched.

## Create a new IP list from the vulnerability scan provider IP range or addresses {#create-a-new-ip-list-from-the-vulnerability-scan-provider-ip-range-or-addresses}

Have handy the IP addresses that the vulnerability scan provider has given you.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Server & Workload Protection console, go to *Policies*.

2.  In the left pane, expand **Lists → IP Lists**.

3.  Click **New → New IP List**.

4.  Type a *Name* for the new IP List, for example "Qualys IP list".

5.  Paste the IP addresses that the vulnerability management provider has given you into the *IP(s)* box, one per line.

6.  Click *OK*.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

## Create firewall rules for incoming and outbound scan traffic {#create-firewall-rules-for-incoming-and-outbound-scan-traffic}

After you’ve created the IP list, you need to create two firewall rules: one for incoming and one for outgoing traffic. Name them as suggested, below:

`<name of provider> Vulnerability Traffic - Incoming`

`<name of provider> Vulnerability Traffic - Outgoing`

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  In the Server & Workload Protection console, click *Policies*.

2.  In the left pane, expand *Rules*.

3.  Click **Firewall Rules → New → New Firewall Rule**.

4.  Create the first rule to bypass Inbound AND Outbound for TCP and UDP connections that are incoming to and outgoing from the vulnerability management provider.

    :::tip

    For settings not specified, you can leave them as the default.
    :::

    - *Name:* (suggested) `<name of provider> Vulnerability Traffic - Incoming`
    - *Action:* Bypass
    - *Protocol:* Any
    - *Packet Source:* IP List and then select the new IP list created above.

5.  Create a second rule:

    - *Name:* `<name of provider> Vulnerability Traffic - Outgoing`
    - *Action:* Bypass
    - *Protocol:* Any
    - *Packet Source:* IP List and then select the new IP list created above.

### Next steps {#next-steps-1}

## Assign the new firewall rules to a policy to bypass vulnerability scans {#assign-the-new-firewall-rules-to-a-policy-to-bypass-vulnerability-scans}

Identify which policies are already used by computers that will be scanned by the vulnerability management provider.

Edit the policies individually to assign the rules in the firewall module.

### Procedure {#procedure-2}

1.  Click *Policies* on the main menu.

2.  Click *Policies* in the left pane.

3.  In the right pane, for each policy, double-click to open the policy details.

4.  In the pop-up, in the left pane, click *Firewall*.

5.  Under *Assigned Firewall Rules*, click *Assign/Unassign*.

6.  Ensure your view at the top-left shows *All* firewall rules.

7.  Use the search window to find the rules you created and select them.

8.  Click *OK*.
