### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **Schedule** section, specify the Scheduled Scan frequency:

    - **Daily**: Scans every day at the specified time

    - **Weekly, every \<day_of_week\>**: Scans once a week on the specified day at the specified time

    - **Monthly, on day \<number\>**: Scans once a month on the specified day at the specified time

    - **Monthly, on the \<ordinal\> \<day_of_week\>**: Scans once a month on the specified weekday at the specified time

    :::warning[Important]

    If you select a day that does not exist within a given month (for example, day "30" does not exist in February), the Scheduled Scan occurs on the last day of that month.
    :::

    :::note

    When configuring a parent policy, specify how other users can configure child policies.

    - **Inherit from parent**: Child policies must use the settings configured in the parent policy

    - **Are customizable**: Other administrators can configure child policies to be different than the parent policy settings.
    :::

2.  In the **Files to Scan** section, select from the following:

    - **All scannable files**: Includes all scannable files. Unscannable files are password protected files, encrypted files, or files that exceed the user-defined scanning restrictions.

      :::note

      This option provides the maximum security possible. However, scanning every file requires a lot of time and resources and might be redundant in some situations. Therefore, you might want to limit the amount of files the agent includes in the scan.
      :::

    - **File types scanned by IntelliScan**: Scans files based on true-file type.

    - **Files with the following extensions (use commas to separate entries)**: Manually specify the files to scan based on their extensions. Separate multiple entries with commas.

      :::note

      When configuring a parent policy, specify how other users can configure child policies.

      - **Inherit from parent**: Child policies must use the settings configured in the parent policy

      - **Extend from parent**: Child policies can append additional settings to the settings inherited from the parent policy
      :::

3.  In the **Scan Settings** section, configure the required settings.

4.  In the **CPU Usage** section, select from the following:

    - **High**: No pausing between scans

    - **Medium**: Pause between file scans if CPU consumption is higher than 50%, and do not pause if 50% or lower

    - **Low**: Pause between file scans if CPU consumption is higher than 20%, and do not pause if 20% or lower
