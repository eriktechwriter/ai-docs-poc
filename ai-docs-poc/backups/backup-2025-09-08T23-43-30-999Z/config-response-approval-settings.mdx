Enable auto approval and specify response actions and endpoints that support auto approval.

1.  Go to **Agentic SIEM & XDR â†’ Managed Services**.

2.  Select **Enable auto approval** to automatically approve certain response actions the Managed Services team can execute.

    Only a subset of actions in Trend Vision One apps are available for auto approval.
