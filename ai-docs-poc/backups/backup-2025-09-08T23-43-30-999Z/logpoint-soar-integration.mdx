Allow Logpoint to collect event information, enrich Workbench alerts, and automate response actions in the Trend Vision One console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, obtain the **Authentication token**.

    1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation â†’ Third-Party Integration**.

    2.  Select **Logpoint SOAR**.

    3.  Use the copy icon (![](/images/copyicon=GUID-BD854E6D-5EB9-4181-BE68-D5F743237995=1=en-us=Low.webp)) to obtain the **Authentication token**.

2.  Use the authentication token to configure the integration in the Logpoint console.

    For detailed instructions, sign in to Logpoint and see the [related Logpoint SOAR documentation](https://servicedesk.logpoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003788449-Trend-Micro).

    Logpoint begins collecting data from Trend Vision One, enriching Workbench alerts, and automating response actions in the Trend Vision One console. Logpoint can only collect data generated after configuring the integration. You might need to allow some time before new data starts to appear in the Logpoint console.
