To switch a Service Gateway 1.0 appliance to a version later than 2.0, you must [migrate](migrating-service-gateway-1-0-2-0.mdx) or [upgrade](upgrading-service-gateway-1-0-2-0.mdx) the appliance to 2.0, and then upgrade it to the latest version.

For more information about 2.0 to 3.0 upgrade, see [Upgrade from Service Gateway 2.0 to 3.0](upgrading-service-gateway-23.mdx).
