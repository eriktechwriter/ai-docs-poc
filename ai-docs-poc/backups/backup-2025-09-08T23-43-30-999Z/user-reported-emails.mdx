Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection provides you visibility into the emails that your users report as a spam, phishing, or not a risk through the add-in for Outlook or the warning banner in anomalous emails detected by predefined correlation rules in Correlated Intelligence. On the **User-Reported Emails** screen, you can get the volume and variety of the reported emails and view the details of each report email.

If you have multiple organizations, select an organization to view data.

The following table details the sections available on the **User-Reported Emails** screen.
