Identify managed and unmanaged devices that may contribute to your organization's attack surface and add discovered devices that should not be assessed to the exception list.

Attack Surface Discovery detects physical devices and servers connected to your organization's network, including devices managed by a Trend Vision One or other Trend Micro agent plus unmanaged devices. After assessment, the devices are categorized and assigned an asset risk score if risks or vulnerabilities are found on the device. Unmanged devices are only displayed for 30 days after discovery.

Assessed devices found to contain risks or vulnerabilities require credits and contribute to your organization's Cyber Risk Index.

The following table describes the fearures available in the **Devices** section of Attack Surface Discovery.
