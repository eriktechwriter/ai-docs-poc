Default relays are available inside Server & Workload Protection. Agents should be able to use them if they can [connect to Server & Workload Protection](swp-port-numbers.mdx).

:::note

[You might need more relays](how-relays-work.mdx) if, for example, you have many computers and want to reduce Internet bandwidth costs.
