October 28, 2024—Cyber Risk Assessment is introducing Identity Posture Assessment, a new complimentary feature for all users. This feature allows you to scan your organization's identity-related assets to detect the assets that might be exposed to attack and identify risk events that most put your assets at risk.

For more information, see [Identity Posture Assessment](identity-posture-assess.mdx).
