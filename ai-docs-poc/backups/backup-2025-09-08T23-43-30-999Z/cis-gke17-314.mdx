Ensure that if the kubelet configuration file exists, it is owned by `root:root`.

The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

The default file ownership is `root:root`.

### Impact {#impact}

Overly permissive file access increases the security risk to the platform.

### Audit {#audit}

Using Google Cloud Console

1.  Go to [Kubernetes Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list).
2.  Click on the desired cluster to open the Details page, then click on the desired Node pool to open the Node pool Details page.
3.  Note the name of the desired node.
4.  Go to [VM Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
5.  Find the desired node and click on **SSH** to open an SSH connection to the node.

Using Command Line

Method 1: SSH to the worker nodes

1.  To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:

    ``` codeblock
    sudo systemctl status kubelet
    ```

2.  The output should return `Active: active (running) since...`. Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate Kubelet config file:

    ``` codeblock
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

3.  The output of the above command should return something similar to `--config/etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.yaml`, which is the location of the Kubelet config file.

4.  Run this command :

    ``` codeblock
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.yaml
    ```

5.  The output of the above command gives you the Kubelet config file's ownership. Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

Method 2: Create and Run a Privileged Pod

1.  Run a pod that is privileged enough to access the host's file system by deploying a pod that uses the hostPath volume to mount the node's file system into the pod. Here's an example of a simple pod definition that mounts the root of the host to /host within the pod:

    ``` codeblock
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: file-check
    spec:
    volumes:
    - name: host-root
    hostPath:
    path: /
    type: Directory
    containers:
    - name: nsenter
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: host-root
    mountPath: /host
    securityContext:
    privileged: true
    ```

2.  Save this to a file (e.g., file-check-pod.yaml) and create the pod:

    ``` codeblock
    kubectl apply -f file-check-pod.yaml
    ```

3.  Once the pod is running, you can exec into it to check file ownership on the node:

    ``` codeblock
    kubectl exec -it file-check -- sh
    ```

4.  Now you are in a shell inside the pod, but you can access the node's file system through the /host directory and check the ownership of the file:

    ``` codeblock
    ls -l /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.yaml
    ```

5.  Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (using the config file location identified in the Audit step):

``` codeblock
chown root:root <kubelet_config_file>
```
