:::: {role="main"}
Switch among multiple SAML-related user accounts to apply the permissions and asset visibility scope of the role assigned to each account.

Any user account with the **Configure account settings** permission can invite users in your identity provider system to single sign-on to the Trend Vision One console and perform operations as different administrator roles. A user can be [added individually as a SAML Account or as a member of a SAML Group Account](configure-vision-accounts.mdx) for different administrative purposes. Each user account is assigned a [role](user-roles-foundation-services.mdx) with specified permissions and [asset visibility scope](asset-visibility-management.mdx). A user associated with multiple SAML-based user accounts can switch among the accounts to apply the permissions and asset visibility scope of the role assigned to an account.

:::note

If a user is added to multiple SAML account types in Trend Vision One, they can switch user accounts as follows:

- Between SAML Accounts and SAML Group Accounts

- Between IdP-Only SAML Group Accounts only if they are not a user of either a SAML Account or SAML Group Account
