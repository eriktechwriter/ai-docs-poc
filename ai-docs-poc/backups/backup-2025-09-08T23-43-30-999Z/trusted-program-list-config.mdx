The Trusted Program List excludes programs and all child processes called by the program from Real-time Scan.

You can configure Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents to skip scanning of trusted processes during Real-time Scan and event recording. After adding a program to the Trusted Program List, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent does not subject the program or any processes initiated by the program to Real-time Scan and event recording. Add trusted programs to the Trusted Program List to improve the performance of scanning on endpoints.

You can add files to the Trusted Program List if the following requirements are met:

- The file is not located in the system directory.
