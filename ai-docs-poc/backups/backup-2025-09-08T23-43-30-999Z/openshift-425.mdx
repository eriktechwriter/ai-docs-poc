Profile applicability: Level 1

Disable the read-only port.

The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster.

:::note

By default, in OpenShift 4.5 and earlier, the `--read-only-port` is not used. In OpenShift 4.6 and above, the `kubelet-read-only-port` is set to 0.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

Removal of the read-only port will require that any service which made use of it will need to be re-configured to use the main Kubelet API.

### Audit {#audit}

In OpenShift 4, the kubelet is managed by the Machine Config Operator. The kubelet config file is found at `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`. OpenShift disables the read-only port (10255) on all nodes by setting the `read-only-port` kubelet flag to 0 by default in OpenShift 4.6 and above.

Run the following command to verify the `kubelet-read-only-port` is set to 0 for the Kubernetes API server configuration map.

``` codeblock
oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get cm config -o json | jq -r
'.data."config.yaml"' | yq '.apiServerArguments."kubelet-read-only-port"'
```

Verify the output is a list that contains 0, like the following:

``` codeblock
[
"0"
]
```

### Remediation {#remediation}

In earlier versions of OpenShift 4, the `read-only-port` argument is not used. Follow the instructions in the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.mdx) to create a `kubeletconfig` CRD and set the `kubelet-read-only-port` is set to 0.
