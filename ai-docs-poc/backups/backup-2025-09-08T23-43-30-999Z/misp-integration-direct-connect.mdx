Trend Vision One enables transfer of suspicious object data and retrieval of threat intelligence data directly with the MISP threat sharing platform.

:::note

To enable the transfer of suspicious object data and retrieval of MISP threat intelligence data through a Service Gateway, see [MISP integration (via Service Gateway)](misp-integration.mdx).
:::

:::warning[Important]

- The MISP API does not return unpublished events for version 2.4.717 or later. Publish events on the MISP server to ensure that threat intelligence data can be sent to Trend Vision One.

- To send MISP attributes as suspicious objects to Trend Vision One, add the Intrusion Detection System flag. This determines if the attribute can be automated.

- For more information about MISP instance sizing, see [Sizing your MISP instance](https://www.misp-project.org/sizing-your-misp-instance/).
