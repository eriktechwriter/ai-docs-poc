Data Loss Prevention (DLP) safeguards an organization's confidential and sensitive data, referred to as digital assets, against accidental disclosure and intentional theft. DLP allows you to:

- Identify the digital assets to protect

- Create policies that limit or prevent the transmission of digital assets through email

- Enforce compliance to established privacy standards

DLP evaluates data against a set of rules defined in policies. Policies determine the data that must be protected from unauthorized transmission and the action that DLP performs when it detects transmission.

With DLP, Cloud Email Gateway Protection allows you to manage your incoming email messages containing sensitive data and protects your organization against data loss by monitoring your outbound email messages.
