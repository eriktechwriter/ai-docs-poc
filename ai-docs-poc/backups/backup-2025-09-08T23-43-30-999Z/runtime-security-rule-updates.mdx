March 5, 2024â€”The Runtime Security scout component has been updated to allow for the download of larger Runtime Security rule files. Customers should upgrade clusters that are running scout versions older than 2.3.26 (template version 1.0.8 for ECS) to the latest available version to ensure that they have access to new Runtime Security rules as they become available. Older versions of scout continue to receive rules and your existing installations retain their protection, but they cannot be updated as frequently with new rules due to file size limitations.

Instructions on upgrading Runtime Security:

- For Kubernetes clusters: [Upgrade your Container Security deployment](container-security-faqs.mdx)

- For ECS clusters: [Upgrade your Cloud Account Management stack](stack-update.mdx)
