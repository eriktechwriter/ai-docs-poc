Configure distribution settings to enable Apex Central to consolidate and send Virtual Analyzer and user-defined suspicious objects (excluding exceptions) to certain managed products. These products synchronize and use all or some of these objects.

Apex Central can also send suspicious IP addresses and domains to TippingPoint.

:::note

The **Distribution Settings** also allows you to configure Suspicious Object Hub and Node Apex Central server settings to synchronize suspicious object lists across multiple Apex Central servers.

For more information, see [Suspicious Object Hub and Node Architecture](so-hub-node-arch.mdx).
