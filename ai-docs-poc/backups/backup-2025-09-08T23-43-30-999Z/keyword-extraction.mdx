Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also provides Keyword Extraction as a simplified keyword-based way that allows you to quickly identify sensitive information contained in Box files and create rules to limit or prevent the transmission of the data.

## Configuring keyword extraction {#configuring-keyword-extraction}

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Keyword Extraction**.

2.  Select **Enable Keyword Extraction**.

3.  Configure **Rules** settings.

    1.  In **File Format**, select one or multiple file formats to apply the criterion.

        :::note

        Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection scans the specified keywords in text and PDF files, and in the header, footer, and properties of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files.
        :::

    2.  Select **Contain Type** to indicate the condition for the criterion.

    3.  Specify a keyword to scan in the **Keywords** text box, and click **Add**.

        The keyword appears in the blank area.

        Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection scans files for the specified keyword and triggers a keyword extraction rule when the content matches the keyword, including content with the following separators to the left or right of the content: "\t", "\n", "\r", ",", ".", and spaces.

        Take keyword `Internal Use Only` as an example. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection triggers the keyword extraction rule when the content includes **Internal Use Only.** while does not when the content includes **aaINTERNAL USE ONLYbb**.

    4.  Optionally repeat the above step to add more keywords for the selected file format(s).

        :::note

        Optionally click **Import** to import existing keywords in batches from a text file. Make sure that each line in the file contains one keyword.

        Optionally select one or multiple keywords and click **Remove Selected** to delete the keywords.
        :::

    5.  Click **Add to Rule List**.

        :::note

        The setting appears in the **Rule List** table, each file format per line.

        You can add keywords for a single file format in multiple times, and all these keywords will be combined into one rule.
        :::

    6.  Optionally repeat steps a through e if you need to set another condition for a file format.

        :::note

        Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection separates the **Contain** and **Not Contain** conditions in two rules for each file format. It enables you to set actions for each condition rule respectively.
        :::

    7.  Optionally click **Export** to export all the configured keywords.

    8.  Select an action for each rule from the drop-down list.

        In the case of two separate rules for a file format, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection takes the action with the higher priority to a file when keyword(s) in a rule hit the corresponding criterion. The actions come with the following priorities from high to low: **Delete**, **Quarantine**, **Pass**.

        <td><p>Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection deletes the file and replaces it with a placeholder using the original file name and <code>.txt</code>.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Quarantine</p></td>
        <td><p>Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection moves the file to a restricted access folder, removing it as a security risk to protected Box.</p></td>

        <tr>
        <td><p>Pass</p></td>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
