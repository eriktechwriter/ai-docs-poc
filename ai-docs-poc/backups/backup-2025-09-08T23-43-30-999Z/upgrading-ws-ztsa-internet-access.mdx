Set up Internet Access and automatically migrate your settings and access rules from Trend Micro Web Security.

Upgrade from Trend Micro Web Security to Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access to fully integrate your secure web gateway solution with Trend Vision One. Internet Access helps you better enforce access controls and more effectively reduce risk.

The upgrade process migrates your applicable policies, cloud gateways, and other settings from Trend Micro Web Security to Internet Access. Migrated rules have a higher priority than any existing rules in Internet Access.

:::note

- The migration does not modify your current Trend Micro Web Security deployment

- Not all Trend Micro Web Security settings are directly migratable to Internet Access. For more information, see [Trend Micro Web Security Features and Settings Migration](tmws-features-migration.mdx).
