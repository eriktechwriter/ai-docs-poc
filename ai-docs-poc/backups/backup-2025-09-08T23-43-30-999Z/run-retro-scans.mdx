Run retro scans on the historical data captured by existing custom detection models to identify past events that match your defined detection criteria.

:::warning[Important]

- Retro scans analyze historical data up to 7 days in the past.

- The number of concurrent retro scan jobs is limited per company. If your company has reached the limit, you must wait for an ongoing job to complete before starting a new one.

- Retro scan might generate multiple Workbench alerts if matched events are found across different time intervals.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Agentic SIEM & XDR → Detection Model Management → Custom Models**.

2.  Locate the custom model you want to scan historical data for and click the retro scan icon (![](/images/DMMretroScanIcon=6cdd066e-f1c2-4c91-a006-1319a57e5e4f.webp)).

3.  Select the time range from the drop-down menu.

4.  Click **Run retro scan**.

    Once the retro scan is complete, any matched events generate Workbench alerts according to the configurations of your selected models.
