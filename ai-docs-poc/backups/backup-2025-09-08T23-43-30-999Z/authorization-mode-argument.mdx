Ensure that the `--authorization-mode` argument in Kubelets is not set to `AlwaysAllow` to enhance security by enabling explicit authorization. Kubelets configured to allow all authenticated requests, including anonymous ones, without explicit authorization checks from the apiserver can pose a security risk. It is crucial to restrict this behavior so that only explicitly authorized requests are allowed. By setting the `--authorization-mode` to a more restrictive setting, you ensure that unauthorized requests are systematically denied, thereby bolstering the security of your Kubernetes environment.

### Impact {#impact}

Unauthorized requests will be denied.

### Audit {#audit}

Audit method 1:

:::note

Kubelets can be configured via a configuration file or command line arguments. Command line arguments take precedence. Check both command line arguments and configuration file entries when auditing Kubelet configurations.
:::

1.  SSH into each node and run the following command to view details of the active Kubelet process:

    ``` codeblock
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

2.  Identify the location of the configuration file from the --config argument in the output. View the file using:

    ``` codeblock
    sudo less /path/to/kubelet-config.json
    ```

3.  Verify that Webhook Authentication is enabled:

    - Command line argument to the Kubelet service:

      ``` codeblock
      --authentication-token-webhook
      ```

    - In the Kubelet configuration file:

      ``` codeblock
              {
              "authentication": {
              "webhook": {
              "enabled": true
              }
              }
              }
             
      ```

4.  Verify that the Authorization Mode is set to WebHook:

    - Command line argument to the Kubelet service:

      ``` codeblock
      --authorization-mode=Webhook
      ```

    - In the Kubelet configuration file:

      ``` codeblock
              {
              "authorization": {
              "mode": "Webhook"
              }
              }
             
      ```

Audit method 2:

Review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the "/configz" endpoint of the Kubernetes API using kubectl:

1.  Discover all nodes in your cluster:

    ``` codeblock
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

2.  Initiate a proxy with kubectl on a local port (e.g., 8080):

    ``` codeblock
    kubectl proxy --port=8080
    ```

3.  In a separate terminal, run the following command for each node:

    ``` codeblock
    export NODE_NAME=my-node-name
          curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/nodes/${NODE_NAME}/proxy/configz
    ```

4.  Verify that Webhook Authentication is enabled by checking the API response:

    ``` codeblock
          {
          "authentication": {
          "webhook": {
          "enabled": true
          }
          }
          }
         
    ```

5.  Verify that the Authorization Mode is set to WebHook by checking the API response:

    ``` codeblock
          {
          "authorization": {
          "mode": "Webhook"
          }
          }
         
    ```

### Remediation {#remediation}

Method 1:

1.  SSH into each node.

2.  Locate the Kubelet configuration file:

    ``` codeblock
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

3.  View the configuration file using:

    ``` codeblock
    sudo less /path/to/kubelet-config.json
    ```

4.  Enable Webhook Authentication by setting the following parameter:

    ``` codeblock
          {
          "authentication": {
          "webhook": {
          "enabled": true
          }
          },
          "authorization": {
          "mode": "Webhook"
          }
          }
         
    ```

5.  Restart the kubelet service and check its status (example for systems using systemd):

    ``` codeblock
    systemctl daemon-reload
          systemctl restart kubelet.service
          systemctl status kubelet -l
    ```

Method 2:

1.  If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file to include the following parameters:

    ``` codeblock
    --authentication-token-webhook
          --authorization-mode=Webhook
    ```

2.  For systems using systemd, edit the file located at /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf.

3.  Restart the kubelet service and check its status (example for systems using systemd):

    ``` codeblock
          systemctl daemon-reload
          systemctl restart kubelet.service
          systemctl status kubelet -l
    ```
