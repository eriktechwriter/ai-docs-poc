Find the UUID for a Linux-based resource to assist with remediation when malware is detected by Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection.

Universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) are used to help identify partitions related to malware detection by Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection. You may use the UUID to search for more information, such as the location of the malware, about the detection in XDR Data Explorer. To find the UUID for a Linux-based partition:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Use the `blkid` command.

    1.  Type `sudo blkid` to return a list of all available disk partitions on your Linux system and the associated attributes, including UUIDs when available.

        :::note

        The `sudo blkid` command also returns information on loop devices.
        :::

    2.  Type `sudo blkid | grep UUID=` to return information only on disk partitions on your Linux system that have available UUIDs.

2.  Use the `lsblk` command.

    1.  Type `sudo lsblk -f` to return a structured view of all available disk partitions on your Linux system and the associated attributes, including UUIDs when available.

        :::note

        The `sudo lsblk -f` command also returns information on loop devices. You must use the `-f` option with `lsblk` to return file system information.
        :::

    2.  Type `sudo lsblk -f | grep -v loop` to return a structured view of only disk partitions on your Linux system that have available UUIDs.
