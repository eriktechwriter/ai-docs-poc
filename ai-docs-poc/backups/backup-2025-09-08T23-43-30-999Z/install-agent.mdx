## Install the agent manually {#install-the-agent-manually}

:::warning[Important]

To deploy the Server & Workload Protection agent with endpoint sensor and full XDR functionality, download and deploy the agent package from Endpoint Inventory. For more information, see [Deploy agents](deploy-agents.mdx).

Computers added using this method do not support the endpoint sensor and do not have XDR functionality. Trend Micro recommends only using this method for testing purposes or troubleshooting with your support provider.
:::

Before you begin, make sure you have:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Reviewed the agent's system requirements. See [Agent requirements](swp-agent-sys-requirements.mdx).

2.  Windows only: [Disable Windows Defender on Windows Server 2016 or later.](ds-defender-antivirus-win.mdx)

3.  Allowed inbound and outbound communication to and from the agent on the appropriate port numbers. See [Server & Workload Protection Port numbers](swp-port-numbers.mdx).

4.  Exported the agent software from the Server & Workload Protection console. See [Export the agent installer](get-agent-software.mdx).

### Next steps {#next-steps}

Next, install the agent. Follow the instructions for your platform.

## Install the agent on Windows {#install-the-agent-on-windows}

1.  Copy the agent ZIP to the computer and extract it.
2.  Double-click the installation file (.MSI file) to run the installer package.

    :::note

    On Windows Server 2012 R2 Server Core, launch the installer using this command instead: `msiexec /i Agent-Core-Windows-12.x-xxxx.x86_64.msi`
    :::
3.  At the Welcome screen, click *Next* to begin the installation.
4.  *End-User License Agreement:* If you agree to the terms of the license agreement, select *I accept the terms of the license agreement* and click *Next*.
5.  *Destination Folder:* Select the location where you want to install the agent and click *Next*.
6.  *Ready to install Trend Micro Deep Security Agent:* Click *Install* to proceed with the installation.
7.  *Completed:* when the installation has completed successfully, click *Finish*.

The agent is now installed and running on this computer, and will start every time the machine boots.

:::note

When installing the agent on Windows 2012 Server Core, the notifier will not be included.
:::

:::note

During an install, network interfaces will be suspended for a few seconds before being restored. If you are using DHCP, a new request will be generated, potentially resulting in a new IP address for the restored connection.

## Installation on Amazon WorkSpaces {#installation-on-amazon-workspaces}

If you are unable to install the agent .msi file due to error code ‘2503’ then you must do one of the following:

- Edit your C:\Windows\Temp folder and allow the write permission for your user
- Open the command prompt as an administrator and run the .msi file

:::note

Amazon has fixed this issue for newly-deployed Amazon WorkSpaces.
:::

## Installation on Windows 2012 Server Core {#installation-on-windows-2012-server-core}

- Server & Workload Protection does not support switching the Windows 2012 server mode between Server Core and Full (GUI) modes after the agent is installed.
- If you are using Server Core mode in a Hyper-V environment, you will need to use Hyper-V Manager to remotely manage the Server Core computer from another computer. When the Server Core computer has the agent installed and Firewall enabled, the Firewall will block the remote management connection. To manage the Server Core computer remotely, turn off the Firewall module.
- Hyper-V provides a migration function used to move a guest VM from one Hyper-V server to another. The Server & Workload Protection Firewall module will block the connection between Hyper-V servers, so you will need to turn off the Firewall module to use the migration function.

## Install the agent on Red Hat, Amazon, SUSE, Oracle, or Cloud Linux {#install-the-agent-on-red-hat-amazon-suse-oracle-or-cloud-linux}

1.  Copy the agent ZIP to the computer and extract it.

2.  Install the agent.

## Install the agent on Solaris {#install-the-agent-on-solaris}

:::note

The agent installation is only supported in the global zone.
:::

Solaris requires the following libraries to be installed to support the agent:

*Solaris 10:* SUNWgccruntime

*Solaris 11.0 - 11.3:* gcc-45-runtime

*Solaris 11.4:* none; gcc-c-runtime version 7.3 is installed by default

1.  Copy the agent installer package to the computer where you want to install the agent.

2.  Unzip the ZIP file.

3.  Unzip the GZ file: `gunzip <agent_GZ_file>`

    The agent installer file (P5P or PKG) is now available.

4.  Install the agent. Some examples of installation commands are provided below. Alter the commands to suit your Solaris version, Solaris zone, Solaris processor, and agent package name.
    - On Solaris 11, with one zone, run the following command in the global zone:

      x86: `pkg install -g file:///mnt/Agent-Solaris_5.11-xx.x.x-xxxx.x86_64/Agent-Core-Solaris_5.11-xx.x.x-xxxx.x86_64.p5p pkg:/security/ds-agent`

      SPARC: `pkg install -g file:///mnt/Agent-Solaris_5.11-xx.x.x-xxxx.sparc/Agent-Core-Solaris_5.11-xx.x.x-xxxx.sparc.p5p pkg:/security/ds-agent`

    - On Solaris 11, with multiple zones, run the following command in the global zone:

      ``` codeblock
      mkdir <path>
      pkgrepo create <path>
      pkgrecv -s file://<path_to_agent_p5p_file> -d <path> '*'
      pkg set-publisher -g <path> trendmicro
      pkg install pkg://trendmicro/security/ds-agent
      pkg unset-publisher trendmicro
      rm -rf <path>
      ```

    - On Solaris 10, run one of these commands:

      x86: `pkgadd -G -d Agent-Core-Solaris_5.10_Ux-xx.x.x-xxx.x86_64.pkg`

      SPARC: `pkgadd -G -d Agent-Core-Solaris_5.10_Ux-xx.x.x-xxx.sparc.pkg`

To start, stop, or reset the agent:

- Start: `svcadm enable ds_agent`
- Stop: `svcadm disable ds_agent`
- Reset: `/opt/ds_agent/dsa_control -r`
- Restart: `svcadm restart ds_agent`
- Display status: `svcs -a | grep ds_agent`

To uninstall the agent on Solaris 11:

`pkg uninstall pkg:/security/ds-agent`

To uninstall the agent on Solaris 10:

`pkgrm -v ds-agent`

## Install the agent on AIX {#install-the-agent-on-aix}

### Procedure {#procedure-2}

1.  Copy the agent ZIP to the computer and extract it. A GZ file becomes available.

2.  Move the GZ file to another location.

3.  Extract the GZ file using gunzip. A BFF file becomes available. This is the installer file.

4.  Copy the BFF file to the AIX computer.

5.  Place the BFF file in a temporary folder such as /tmp.

6.  Install the agent: `/tmp> installp -a -d /tmp/<agent_BFF_file_name> ds_agent` where `<agent_BFF_file_name>` is replaced with the name of the BFF installer file you extracted.

### Next steps {#next-steps-2}

To start, stop, load, or unload the driver for the agent:

- Start: `startsrc -s ds_agent`
- Stop: `stopsrc -s ds_agent`
- Load the driver: `/opt/ds_agent/ds_fctrl load`
- Unload the driver: `/opt/ds_agent/ds_fctrl unload`

## Install the agent using other methods {#install-the-agent-using-other-methods}

If you don't want to install the agent manually, you can use one of the methods described below.

- *Deployment scripts:* Generate deployment scripts within the Server & Workload Protection console and use them to install the agent. For details, see [Use deployment scripts to add and protect computers](deployment-scripts-add-computers.mdx).
- Server & Workload Protection API: Use the API to generate deployment scripts to automate the installation of the agent on a computer. See [Use Scripts to Deploy Server & Workload Protection and the agent](api-generate-agent-deploy.mdx).
- *SCCM:* Use Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to install an agent, activate it, and apply a policy. To use SCCM, go to **Administration → System Settings → Agents** and enable agent-initiated activation.
- *Template:* Include the agent in your VM template. See [Install the agent on an AMI or WorkSpace bundle](install-agent-ami-workspace.mdx) and [Install the agent on Azure VMs](install-agent-azure-vms.mdx).
- *MDM:* Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to install an agent, activate it, and apply a policy. See [Configure Mobile Device Management on Server & Workload Protection for the macOS agent](configure-mdm-macos-agent.mdx).

## Post-installation tasks {#post-installation-tasks}

After you install the agent, you must perform the following post-installation tasks, if they were not already completed as part of the installation process:
