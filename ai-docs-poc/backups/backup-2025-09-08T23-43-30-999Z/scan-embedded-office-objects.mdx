For macOS agents, scanning embedded Microsoft Office objects is not supported.
:::

Certain versions of Microsoft Office use Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to insert files and other objects into Office files. These embedded objects can contain malicious code.

Specify the number of OLE layers to scan to detect objects that are embedded in other objects. To reduce the impact on performance, you can scan only a few layers of embedded objects within each file.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Open the properties of the malware scan configuration.

2.  On the **Advanced tab**, select **Scan Embedded Microsoft Office Objects**.

3.  Specify the number of OLE layers to scan.

4.  Click **OK**.
