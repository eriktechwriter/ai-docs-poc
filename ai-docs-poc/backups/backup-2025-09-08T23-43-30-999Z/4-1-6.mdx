Profile applicability: Level 1 - Worker Node

Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, `kubelet.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Audit {#audit}

Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the \<PATH\>/\<FILENAME\> of the kubelet config file. Set $kubelet_config=\<PATH\> based on the file location on your system:

``` codeblock
export kubelet_config=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
```

To perform the audit manually, run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

``` codeblock
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

``` codeblock
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
```
