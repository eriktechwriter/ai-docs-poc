Connect your identity provider tenants to Identity Inventory to get centralized visibility of identities in your organization.

To take advantage of the features in **Identity Inventory**, Trend Vision One requires you to grant multiple permissions from a supported identity provider (IdP) in **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration**. For Active Directory (On-premises), you must also configure a deployed Service Gateway in **Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management**.

:::tip

Find the desired IdP in Third-Party Integration by selecting the **Identity and Access Management** filter.
:::

Supported IdPs include:

- [Microsoft Entra ID](grant-entra-id-permissions.mdx)

- [Active Directory (On-premises)](active-directory-identity-inventory.mdx)
