Learn how to connect Deep Discovery Inspector appliances with Network Inventory.

:::warning[Important]

- **Network Security** supports connecting with Deep Discovery Inspector version 5.7 Service Pack 3 or later. If your appliance is using a previous version (5.7 Service Pack 2 or prior), upgrade to the latest version to connect to **Network Security**.

- If you have connected your Deep Discovery Inspector appliances to Trend Vision One using Deep Discovery Director, you must reset Network Inventory before reconnecting your appliances.
:::

You can connect your Deep Discovery Inspector appliances to Trend Vision One in the Network Inventory app. Network Inventory also provides the ability to deploy a Deep Discovery Inspector virtual appliance to AWS.

If you have not deployed a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, you can download the appliance image from the [Customer Success Portal](https://success.trendmicro.com/dcx/s/license). For deployment steps, see the Deep Discovery Inspector Installation and Deployment Guide on the [Deep Discovery Inspector help center](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/deep-discovery-inspector/).

View the following connection guides based your appliance version and preferred connection method:

- To connect Deep Discovery Inspector versions 5.7 Service Pack 3 or later directly with Trend Vision One, see [Connecting a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance directly](connecting-ddi-directly.mdx)

- To connect Deep Discovery Inspector versions 6.7 or later using a Service Gateway as a proxy, see [Connecting a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance using Service Gateway as a proxy](ddi-connect-service-gateway.mdx).

- To deploy a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance to AWS, see [Deploying a Deep Discovery Inspector virtual appliance on AWS](deploying-ddi-appliance-aws.mdx).

After connecting your Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, review the following topics to further integrate your appliance with Trend Vision One services:

- [Enable Network Sensor](deep-discovery-inspector-appliances.mdx) to allow sharing network data with Trend Vision One detection and response apps such as [Workbench](workbench.mdx).

- Review the [sandbox options available](sandbox-deep-discovery-inspector.mdx) for sharing and analyzing suspicious objects with Suspicious Object Management and Sandbox Analysis.

- [Connect to a Service Gateway](configuring-ddi-connections.mdx) to allow access to additional services.
