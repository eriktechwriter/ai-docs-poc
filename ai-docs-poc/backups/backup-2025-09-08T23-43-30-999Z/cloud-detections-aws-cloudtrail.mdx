September 28, 2023—Cloud Detections for AWS CloudTrail is now available as a pre-release feature which can be enabled in the Cloud Accounts app. This feature set deploys Cloud Audit Log Monitoring in your AWS account to get actionable insight into user, service, and resource activity with detection models identifying activity such as privilege escalation, password modification, attempted data exfiltration, and potentially unsanctioned MFA changes.

For more information, see [AWS features and permissions](aws-features-permissions.mdx).
