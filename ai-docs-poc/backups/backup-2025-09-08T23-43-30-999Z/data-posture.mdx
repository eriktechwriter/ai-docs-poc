Get instant visibility into cloud assets containing sensitive data. Data Security Posture helps you understand your organization's data risk, and to view and address cloud assets with the riskiest sensitive data.

Data Security Posture uses Terraform templates to deploy and execute a script in your AWS or Azure cloud environment. You can enable Data Security Posture when adding a new cloud account or updating an existing one in Cloud Accounts. The process to enable Data Security Posture differs for AWS and Azure accounts:

- For AWS accounts, you deploy a CloudFormation template in your AWS environment. For more information, see [Enable Data Security Posture for your AWS cloud accounts](data-posture-for-aws-accounts.mdx).

- For Azure subscriptions, you deploy a Terraform template, which runs a script in your Azure environment to allow Trend Vision One to monitor changes in your storage accounts. For more information, see [Enable Data Security Posture on an Azure subscription](data-security-posture-azure.mdx).

After enabling Data Security Posture, Trend Vision One can discover and classify sensitive data in your cloud accounts, and predict potential attack paths for data leakage due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

Data Security Posture monitors cloud assets for sensitive data. To monitor devices and files in a network location, you must create data policies that identify the network locations that you want to monitor. For more information, see [Data Policy](data-policy-overview.mdx).
