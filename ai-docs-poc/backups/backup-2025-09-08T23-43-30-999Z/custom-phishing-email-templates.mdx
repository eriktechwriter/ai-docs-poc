Create custom templates for phishing simulation emails to tailor the simulation emails to your organization's needs.

When you create a phishing simulation, you must choose an email template to send to users as the simulation email. **Phishing Simulations** provides standard simulation email templates with different languages, difficulty levels, and target audiences. You can also create your own simulation email template using images, text, and links of your choice.

:::warning[Important]

Some entities, including government and financial organizations, are sensitive to the use of their logos in content related to phishing simulations. Trend Micro is not responsible for any issues that may arise if you upload and use trademarked images in your phishing simulation content. Encourage employees to report suspicious emails to your IT or information security team for investigation before reporting the emails to a trademark owner.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Security Awareness → Phishing Simulations** and click **Email Templates → Custom Templates**.

2.  Click **Create Template**.

    The template editor appears.

3.  Specify a name for the template.

4.  Specify the sender name and email address to be displayed when a user receives the simulation email.

    The sender email address should not be a genuine email address. Consider using an email address with a misspelled account or domain name to give users hints that the email may be a phishing attempt.

6.  Choose the landing page to link to in the simulation email. For security reasons, you may not specify a custom landing page in a custom email template.

7.  Add body text for the email in the template editor. Use the toolbar buttons to format the text.

8.  To add the landing page link to the template, click the insert redirect link button (![](/images/insertRedirectLink=GUID-eff7a907-f6fb-4acc-a4d5-c6f5b242569d.webp)) and specify the anchor text to display.

9.  To add variable content to the template, position your cursor where you want the placeholder to be and select a placeholder from the drop-down menu on the editor toolbar.

10. Add images to the template if desired.

    1.  Click the insert/edit image button (![](/images/insert_edit_image=GUID-4744698c-53cd-4a57-b2e5-45bca68a5685.webp)) on the editor toolbar.

    3.  For better accessibility, provide a title and alt text description for the image.

    4.  Specify the desired width and height of the image in pixels.

    5.  Click **Save**.

11. To edit the template HTML directly, click the source code button (![](/images/sourceCode=GUID-c17fbc72-d73e-49f7-b262-31bd2b92a1ec.webp)) on the editor toolbar to open a secondary editor containing the HTML used for the template.
