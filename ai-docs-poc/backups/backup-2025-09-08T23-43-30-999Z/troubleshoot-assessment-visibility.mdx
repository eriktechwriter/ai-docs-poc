<td><p>Preview version of operating system installed</p></td>
<td><p>The installed operating system is a preview release, which may not receive security updates from the developer. Preview releases sometimes include issues or weaknesses that cause errors and introduce security risk.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An agent or supported third-party vulnerability assessment tool is installed on the endpoint.</p></li>
<li><p>The endpoint is connected to the network.</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr>
<td><p>Trend Cloud One agent outdated</p></td>
<td><p>The Trend Cloud One agent is outdated and no longer supported. The minimum agent versions that support Vulnerability Assessment are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Windows agents: 20.0.0.5531</p></li>
<li><p>Linux agents: 20.0.0.5727</p></li>
