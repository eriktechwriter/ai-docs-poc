The Cloud Risk Index widget provides a comprehensive snapshot of your cloud security posture. It displays your current risk level, the number of high-risk cloud assets, and includes a dynamic graph that tracks changes in the risk index over time. This widget helps you monitor and respond to evolving threats, ensuring your cloud environment remains secure.

The Cloud Risk index is a comprehensive score based on a dynamic assessment of risk factors such as exposure, attack, and security configuration. Cloud Risk falls into three categories: Low, Medium, and High.

From the Cloud Risk Index widget you can:

- Place your cursor over the line graph to view the Cloud Risk Index score for any date in the last 15 days.

- Click the link below the number of high risk cloud assets to open the **Attack Surface Discovery** \> **Cloud Assets** view and investigate the list of high risk assets. See [Attack Surface Discovery](attack-surface-discovery.mdx).
