Configure assignments and priorities to assign policies to your endpoint groups.

:::warning[Important]

- Assignments is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- This feature is not available in all regions.

- Configure policies before creating assignments.

- Trend Micro recommends configuring the **Default Assignment**.

- If this is your first time using the new Endpoint Security Policies, please read [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx). This version of Endpoint Security Policies is an updated and improved version which integrates most features from Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection. However, support for some features is still under development. Review [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx) to avoid any potential interruption to your security environment.

- Enrolling your endpoint groups overwrites any policies assigned to the endpoints by the Protection Manager.
:::

Create and edit assignments and priorities to apply policies to your endpoint groups.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Endpoint Security Policies → Assignments**.

2.  Create or edit an assignment.

    - To create an assignment, click **Add assignment**.

    - To edit an assignment, click the assignment name.

3.  Specify the **Name**.

4.  Select the **Endpoint groups** to add to the assignment.

    1.  Click the edit icon (![](/images/edit_icon=GUID-1F1D1164-5310-4D6D-ACD0-6049C86960AF.webp)).

        The **Select endpoint group** window appears.

    2.  Locate and select the endpoint groups you want to add.

        Expand endpoint groups view your group structure and locate child groups. Use the search to find groups by name.

        :::note

        - You can add child groups to a different assignment than the parent group.

        - You can remove endpoint groups from the assignment by clearing the selection.

        - Endpoint groups not added to an assignment you create are added to the **Default Assignment**.

        - You cannot remove endpoint groups from the **Default Assignment** using the **Select endpoint group** window.

    3.  Click **Select**.

5.  Configure the **Base priority**.

    1.  Select the policy to apply to the **Base priority**.

        :::note

        The criteria for the base priority is **All endpoints** and cannot be changed. Endpoints which do not match any other priority in the assignment use the base priority.
        :::

6.  To add a priority, click **Add priority** and specify a name.

    You can add up to fifteen priorities. If an endpoint matches more than one priority, the endpoint applies the policy of the highest ranking priority (Priority 1 is highest, Priority 15 is lowest). Endpoints that do not match any priority use the base priority.

7.  To rename a priority, click the options icon (![](/images/options=ddb0b67f-0654-4aa5-8bc7-48ec554c5448.webp)) and select **Rename**.

8.  To delete a priority, click the options icon (![](/images/options=ddb0b67f-0654-4aa5-8bc7-48ec554c5448.webp)) and select **Delete**.

    :::note

    You cannot delete the Base priority.
    :::

9.  To change the order of a priority, click and drag the priority to the desired order.

10. Configure the priority.

    1.  Click the priority name to edit the configuration.

    2.  Select the **Criteria**.

        - **Endpoint name**: Apply the policy to any endpoint with a name that contains at least one specified value. For example, the value `Sample` matches endpoints with the names `Sample1`, `Sample2`, and `25Sample`. The value does not match `Sam`.

        - **Operating system**: Apply the policy to any endpoint with the specified OS. Click the edit icon () to select the OS. You can specify a specific OS version (such as Windows 11) or OS family (such as Linux).

        - **IP range**: Apply the policy to any endpoint within the specified IP range. You can specify up to three IP ranges.

    3.  Click **Add criteria** to add additional criteria.

        You can specify up to three criteria. Criteria uses AND logic. For example, if you select Windows for the operating system and Endpoint name `Sample`, the priority applies to an endpoint named `Sample11` that has Windows 11 installed. The priority does not apply to an endpoint named `Sample15` that has macOS 15 installed.

        :::warning[Important]

        To prevent creating a priority that cannot apply to any of your endpoints, Trend Micro recommends only using a criteria type once. For example, do not select IP range for **Criteria 1** and **Criteria 2**. Since endpoints only have one IP address, two sets of ranges cause the priority to not match any endpoints.
        :::

    4.  Select the **Policy** to apply to endpoints that match the priority criteria.

11. Click **Save**.
