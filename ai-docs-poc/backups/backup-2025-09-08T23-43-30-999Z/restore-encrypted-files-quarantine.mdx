Restore files encrypted and quarantined by the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent.

:::danger[Warning]

Restoring an infected file can spread the virus/malware to other files and computers. Before restoring the file, isolate the infected endpoint and move important files on this endpoint to a backup location.
:::

How the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent handles the process of quarantining and encrypting malware files depends on the Protection Managerâ€”Standard Endpoint Protection or Server & Workload Protection. "Sensor-only" Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents do not quarantine malware.

For Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents with **Standard Endpoint Protection**, the Group Manager (Trend Micro Apex One server) handles management of quarantined files. To restore quarantined files, see [Trend Success Portal: Restoring files that have been quarantined by Apex One](https://success.trendmicro.com/en-US/solution/KA-0013825).

For Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents with **Server & Workload Protection**, your agents store quarantined files on the endpoint. To restore quarantined files, see [View and restore identified malware](view-restore-identified-malware.mdx).
