Centrally manage the recipients that receive notifications about policy match or about system-level events.

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 25%" />
    <col style="width: 75%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th><p>Action</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>

    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Apply a recipient group to all policies</p></td>

    <p>After you apply a recipient group to all policies, the recipient group replaces the original recipients in the policies. Subsequent changes to the recipient group automatically synchronizes to these policies. New polices still use the <strong>Default Recipient Group</strong> as the notification recipients.</p></td>
