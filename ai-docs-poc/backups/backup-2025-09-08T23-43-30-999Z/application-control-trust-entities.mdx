Currently, some trust rule properties only apply to agents on supported Windows platforms and are not yet available on Linux. For details, see Trust rule property limitations for Linux.
:::

:::tip

API documentation is available for [trust rulesets](https://automation.trendmicro.com/cloudone/workload-security/).
:::

The trust entities feature auto-authorizes software changes that match the properties of trust rules assigned to trust rulesets. Each trust rule contains one or more properties that define the parameters for auto-authorizing software changes.

By using the trust entities feature, you can proactively auto-authorize software changes on the agent thus reducing the number of software change events sent to Server & Workload Protection. For example, any agent undergoing regular OS updates creates several new software changes each time a patch is applied. By configuring appropriate trust rules and applying them to those agents, you can auto-authorize the software changes on the agent, and avoid having to manually manage them from the the Server & Workload Protection *Actions* tab or as Application Control security events.

To auto-authorize software changes using trust entities, you need to configure trust rules, assign them to trust rulesets, and assign rulesets to policies or computers.

:::note

For information on how to allow or block software changes that are not being auto-authorized with the trust entities feature, see [View and change Application Control software rulesets](application-control-rulesets.mdx).

## Trust rulesets {#trust-rulesets}

A trust ruleset consists of one or more user-configured trust rules. If you assign a trust ruleset to a policy or computer in Server & Workload Protection, the rules contained in that ruleset are applied to the related workloads and will auto-authorize any software changes that meet its rule property requirements.

## Create a trust ruleset {#create-a-trust-ruleset}

To create a new trust ruleset, do one of the following:

### Procedure {#procedure}

- From the Server & Workload Protection **Policies** tab:

  1.  Go to **Common Objects → Rules → Application Control Rules → Trust Entities**.

  2.  In the *Trust Rulesets* section, select *New*.

  3.  In the *New Ruleset* window, provide a name and, optionally, a description for the new ruleset.

  4.  Select one or more of the trust rules in the list to assign them to your trust ruleset.

:::note

A trust ruleset cannot be deleted if it is currently inherited by or assigned to a computer or policy. You must unassign a trust ruleset before it can be deleted.
:::

## Trust rules {#trust-rules}

A trust rule contains one or more properties that determine which software changes are auto-authorized by Application Control. Software changes that match the properties of a trust rule are auto-authorized and will not create events in Server & Workload Protection.

:::danger[Warning]

Any empty trust rule properties are treated as wildcards. While this gives you freedom in how you customize trust rules, it could also impact the security of your system. To maximize system security and prevent any unwanted software changes from being authorized, try to fill in as many properties as possible when creating trust rules. If you are unsure of the security impact a trust rule might have, check with someone who has a good knowledge of system security or contact Trend Micro before adding it to a trust ruleset.
:::

## Types of trust rules {#types-of-trust-rules}

:::danger[Warning]

When used in an ignore by source rule, the process name property is only supported for agent versions *released after* 20.0.0.3288 (20 LTS Update 2021-10-28).
:::

- *Allow from source* rule auto-authorizes processes with specific properties to create software changes.
- *Allow by target* rule auto-authorizes any software changes that match specific properties.
- *Ignore from source* rule ignores software changes made by a specific process name or within specific paths or both.

:::note

Whenever an allow from source rule auto-authorizes a software change, an entry is added to the local inventory of the agent where the change occurred. This does not occur for ignore from source rules.

## Types of trust rule properties {#types-of-trust-rule-properties}

The properties and values included in a trust rule define which software changes are auto-authorized by that rule. The following sections detail the trust rule property types you can use to configure trust rules, including steps to help you find the information required to configure the property values.

## Process Name {#process-name}

:::danger[Warning]

When used in an ignore from source rule, the process name property is only supported for agent versions *released after* 20.0.0.3288 (20 LTS Update 2021-10-28).
:::

:::note

Deep Security Agent uses wildcards for process names. Where a process names includes the full path to the process, using globstar `**` in a path matches any number of additional characters within the process name, a single asterisk or star `*` matches any number of additional characters within the current directory only, and a `?` matches a single character. The `*` character will stop its search at directory path delimiters (`/` and `\`). The `?` character will not match match directory path delimiters. Drive letters are treated like any other characters in the target path and hold no special significance for matching.
:::

This property specifies the name of the process creating software changes. The process name must use the absolute path of the process, including its file name.

To find a process name of a software change:

### Procedure {#procedure-7}

1.  Go to Server & Workload Protection's *Actions* tab.

2.  Find and select the software change.

### Next steps {#next-steps-6}

The process name will be displayed on the right under *Changed By Process* along with other details.

## Paths {#paths}

:::danger[Warning]

Do not include file names for the paths property. Otherwise, the trust rule to which it belongs may not work as intended.
:::

:::note

Deep Security Agent 20.0.0-5137 adds globstar (`**`) wildcard functionality to paths. Using globstar `**` in a path matches any number of additional characters within the current directory and its subdirectories, a single asterisk or star `*` matches any number of additional characters within the current directory only, and a `?` matches a single character. The `*` character will stop its search at directory path delimiter (`/` and `\`). The `?` character will not match match directory path delimiters. Drive letters are treated like any other characters in the target path and hold no special significance for matching.
:::

This property specifies the target paths applied to a trust rule. Application Control auto-authorizes software changes if they occur within a path entered for this property, including all subdirectories. You can set multiple paths separated by a semicolon. For example, `C:\Windows\;C:\Program Files\`.

When entering values for paths, consider how the last slash (`\` or `/`) in a path affects which directories are included:

- A path ending with a slash will match all sub-directories under that full path. For example, `C:\Windows\System\` would match any sub-directories in the `System` directory.
- A value specified after the last slash is treated as a regular expression wild card, and will match the specific directory as well as any other directories that start with the same value. For example, `C:\Windows\System` would include all directories and sub-directories that match "C:\Windows\System\*" including `C:\Windows\System\`, `C:\Windows\System32\`, `C:\Windows\SystemApps\`, and so on.

## SHA-256 {#sha-256}

When used in an allow from source rule, this specifies the checksum (SHA-256) of the source process creating a software change. When used in an allow by target rule, it is the checksum (SHA-256) of the software change itself.

To find the SHA256, do one of the following:

## From Windows PowerShell (for source or target): {#from-windows-powershell-for-source-or-target}

Follow instructions in the [Windows PowerShell command Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7).

## From Server & Workload Protection (for target only): {#from-server-workload-protection-for-target-only}

## Application Control event aggregation and analysis {#application-control-event-aggregation-and-analysis}

Dynamic software updates on a server can cause thousands of drift events (*Action* page) and security events (*Application Control Events* page). This presents a challenge in the use of Application Control, as it is difficult to know what to approve after the fact. To mitigate the situation while using the Deep Security Agent version 20.0.0.5761 or later, you can create trust rules that allow you to only see atypical drift and security events. This also allows you to put your server in lockdown to prevent any unauthorized software from being executed.

Drift events are aggregated based on the process name and target path. Security events are aggregated based on the SHA256 hash and target path. For example, if the same process creates 10,000 drift items at the same path, the drift would be aggregated to a single trust rule with the `processName` and `paths` attributes.

When diagnostics are requested for the agent, the aggregated drift events and security events are stored in a trust rule format in a JSON file and included in the diagnostics. Then the *Trust Rule* editor can use the JSON file to add the trust rules for the server.

## Drift events {#drift-events}

A drift event in the JSON format has the following attributes:

``` codeblock
{
"time":1615999592250,
"eventType":"ApplicationControl",
"uid":1063,
"gid":1064,
"operationType":"create",
"user":"ribapp",
"group":"ribapp",
"md5":"57579EF7681147B84774F69F44783A67",
"sha256":"90B0418DCB3B29440EE6F69FEE05BD54265CEE3BCFABDA8ED355E257FECC2939",
"processName":"/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/bin/java",
"type":4,
"rdev":0,
"lastModificationTime":1615999090000,
"mode":33188,"size":3984617,
"sha1":"B226BDB9DB39AD38C4BEB6FE4F1C1C7151207848",
"nlink":1,
"procUser":"ribapp",
"isAuthorized":1,
"pid":10223,
"fileExtension":"jar",
"operationDate":1615999591534,
"procUid":1063,
"procGroup":"ribapp",
"path":"/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/devmiesAppSrv/installedApps/devdmrhx01-cell02/IESHSRIDEVM.ear/",
"fileName":"DC.jar",
"recordTime":1615999592215,
"fileSystemType":"ext4",
"procGid":1063,
"dev":64775,
"source":4,
"ino":3801778
}
```

- `processName` is the name of the process that created or updated the target file. In the preceding example, it is set to `/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/bin/java`.

- `path` is the location in which the process updated or created the executable file. In the preceding example, it is set to `/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/devmiesAppSrv/installedApps/devdmrhx01-cell02/IESHSRIDEVM.ear/`.

## Trust rules for drift events {#trust-rules-for-drift-events}

You can create a trust rule to auto-authorize the drift for an event. A trusted updater can be defined via setting `trustType` to 1 for this rule, and you are trusting the process to create software in any path listed in `paths`:

``` codeblock
"trustrules": [{
"trustType":"1",
"processName":"/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/bin/java",
"paths":"/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/devmiesAppSrv/installedApps/devdmrhx01-cell02/IESHSRIDEVM.ear/"
}]
```

Processing drift events to create trust rules can be a many-to-one operation. For example, if the process named `/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/bin/java` creates thousands of JAR files in path `/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/devmiesAppSrv/installedApps/devdmrhx01-cell02/IESHSRIDEVM.ear/`, the preceding trust rule will eliminate drift for all of these JAR files, which makes trust rules efficient at aggregating the drift.

A trust rule consists of an array of rules, with one unique process per rule. Each trust rule can have multiple paths defined in its `paths` attribute. For example, if a process named `process1` has created drift at three distinct locations `path1`, `path2`, `path3`, one trust rule can capture all drift created by `process1` at all of these locations:

``` codeblock
"trustrules": [{
"trustType":"1",
"processName":"process1",
"paths":"path1;path2;path3"
}]
```

There is an additional attribute called `hitcount` whose purpose is a process hit count. You can use this attribute to determine how many times a specific trust rule has been hit.

There is also an extension hit count: extensions are tracked by incrementing each time the process updates a file with a particular extension:

``` codeblock
"trustrules": [{
"trustType":"1",
"processName":"process1",
"paths":"path1;path2;path3",
"hitcount":12342,
".jar":1234,
".py":323,
".":456
}]
```

The preceding example shows a process that has updated JAR files 1234 times, pi files 323 times, and files with no extensions 456 times.

## Security events {#security-events}

A security event in the JSON format has the following attributes:

``` codeblock
{
"time":1492100772165,
"eventType":"ApplicationControl",
"sha1":"066A02D230F3B16439396B049DC912DB376B96CE",
"fileName":"svchost.exe",
"operationType":"detectOnly",
"blockReason":2,
"size":311544,
"sha256":"62EFB22F6853D73374761A0B8ED2CE40BF09AA401EC7D4AAAA0CE4D5C3380EEA",
"type":1,
"path":"C:\\Windows\\System32\\",
"pid":1832,

In the preceding example, `sha256` is set to `62EFB22F6853D73374761A0B8ED2CE40BF09AA401EC7D4AAAA0CE4D5C3380EEA` and `path` is set to `C:\Windows\System32\`.

## Trust rules for security events {#trust-rules-for-security-events}

You can create a trust rule to auto-authorize the drift for a security event. A trusted target can be defined via setting `trustType` to 2 for this rule, based on SHA256 hash, in any path listed in `paths`:

``` codeblock
"trustrules": [{
"trustType":"2",
"sha256":"62EFB22F6853D73374761A0B8ED2CE40BF09AA401EC7D4AAAA0CE4D5C3380EEA",
"paths":"C:\\Windows\\System32\\"
}]
```

Processing security events to create trust rules is a complex operation. A trust rule consists of an array of rules with one unique SHA256 per rule. Each trust rule can have multiple paths defined in its `paths` attribute. For example, if a file is executed with a `sha256` content hash `AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDD` from distinct locations, `path1`, `path2`, and `path3`, one trust rule can represent this as follows:

``` codeblock
"trustrules": [{
"trustType":"2",
"sha256":"AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDD",
"paths":"path1;path2;path3"
}]
```

There is an additional attribute called `hitcount` whose purpose is a SHA256 hit count. You can use this attribute to determine how many times a specific trust rule has been hit.

There is also a file name hit count: files with different names can have the same SHA256 content hash. You can use this attribute to count the number of times a file with a specific name has been used to execute the same SHA256. In the following example, SHA256 `AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEE` has been executed 12342 times, `filename1` has been used 2342 times, and `filename2` has been used 10000 times. Both `filename1` and `filename2` have the same content hash.

Since processes with different names can execute the same target with the same SHA256 content hash, you can also count the number of times that the process name was used to execute the same SHA256. In the following example, SHA256 `AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEE` has been executed 12342 times, `filename1` has been used 2342 times, and `filename2` has been used 10000 times. Both `filename1` and `filename2` have the same content hash. Process name `/opt/process1` was used to execute the target 12000 times and `/opt/process2` was used to execute the target 342 times.

``` codeblock
"trustrules": [{
"trustType":"2",
"sha256":"AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEE",
"paths":"path1;path2;path3",
"hitcount":12342,
"filename1":2342,
"filename2":10000
"/opt/process1":12000,
"/opt/process2":342
}]
```

Note that a process is represented with a full path, while the file name is included in a relative path to one of the paths.

## Event analysis output {#event-analysis-output}

The Application Control event analysis output is directed to a file called `ac_event_analysis.txt`. This file has a trust rule format with additional hit count attributes and extension hit count attributes:

``` codeblock
"trustrules": [{
"trustType":"1",
"processName":"process1",
"paths":"path11;path12;path13",
"hitcount":12342,
".jar":12342
},
{
"trustType":"1",
"processName":"process2",
"paths":"path21;path22;path23",
"hitcount":23232,
".py":23232
},
{
"trustType":"1",
"processName":"process3",
"paths":"path31;path32;path33",
"hitcount":34332,
".exe":34322
},
{
"trustType":"1",
"processName":"process4",
"paths":"path41;path42;path43",
"hitcount":12312,
".":12312
}]
```

The file locations are as follows:

- On Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent\diag\ac_event_analysis.txt`

- On Linux: `/var/opt/ds_agent/diag/ac_event_analysis.txt`

- In the diagnostics: `agent/ac/ac_event_analysis.txt`

The analysis is loaded from this file on restart so that the state is maintained after an agent restart. The analysis is cleared when Application Control is enabled after having been disabled. To view the `ac_event_analysis.txt` file, either use [JQ](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/using-jq-to-process-json-on-the-command-line/) or an [online JSON formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/).

## Debug trust rules {#debug-trust-rules}

You can debug trust rules as follows:

### Procedure {#procedure-18}

1.  Apply new trust rules to Server & Workload Protection.

2.  Stop Deep Security Agent.

3.  Delete the `ac_event_analysis.txt` file.

4.  Start Deep Security Agent.

5.  Wait a few minutes to see if the `ac_event_analysis.txt` file reappears.

    - If the file no longer appears, then the trust rules are working and suppressing the event generation.

    - If the file still appears, inspect the `ac_event_analysis.txt` file for the new event information and add new trust rules accordingly. Trust type 1 rules are Allow by Source rules for auto-approving drift events, whereas trust type 2 rules are Allow by Target rules to allow execution of the target file.

6.  To configure new trust rules, repeat the procedure starting from step 1.

### Next steps {#next-steps-17}

To see how often the trust rules are being hit, execute `sendCommand` on the agent, as follows:

- Linux: `/opt/ds_agent/sendCommand --get TrustRules`
- Windows: `\program files\trend micro\deep security agent\sendCommand --get TrustRules`

## Consult metrics {#consult-metrics}

The drift analysis and event analysis are added to the Application Control metrics, where top ten processes with the highest hit counts are included in the `drift_analysis` object and the top ten SHA256 with the highest counts are stored in the `event_analysis` object:

``` codeblock
"AC": {
"eventReportInQueue":"0",

"hitcount":1,
"paths":"/im1"
}]
}
```

## View signer information {#view-signer-information}

When trust rules are enabled, both the file signer information and process signer information are included in trust rules for the drift events analysis. For security event analysis, the file signer information is included. Trust rules are enabled (the file signer information along with the process signer information is visible in the `ac_event_analysis.txt` file) when a trust entity ruleset is applied to the host.
