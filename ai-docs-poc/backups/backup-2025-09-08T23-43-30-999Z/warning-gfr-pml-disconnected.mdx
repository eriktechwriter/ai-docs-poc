If you see the alert *Census, Good File Reputation, and Predictive Machine Learning Service Disconnected*, there are a few causes:

- Cause 1: The agent or relay-enabled agent doesn't have Internet access
- Cause 2: A proxy was enabled but not configured properly

### Cause 1: The agent or relay-enabled agent doesn't have Internet access {#cause-1-the-agent-or-relay-enabled-agent-doesnt-have-internet-access}

If your agent or relay-enabled agent doesn't have access to the Internet, then it can't reach these services.
