The Endpoint Sensor functions have been replaced by the Endpoint detection and response feature in Endpoint Inventory.

- To manage your Endpoint detection and response settings, see [Endpoint Security Policies](sensor-settings-policies.mdx).

- To override the Endpoint detection and response settings for individual endpoints, use the [policy override features in Endpoint Inventory](endpoint-inventory-intro-part.mdx).
