August 21, 2025—Trend Vision One now supports proxy for self-signed certificates for Kubernetes clusters in Container Security. This enables you to use secure web proxy solutions as a proxy to access the internet and inspect HTTPS traffic.

For more information, see [Proxy Settings Script Generator (for Kubernetes clusters)](proxy-kubernetes-clusters.mdx).
