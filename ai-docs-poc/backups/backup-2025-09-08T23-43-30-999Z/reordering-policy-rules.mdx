::: {role="main"}
For each type of policy, the policy rules for all domains in your organization are arranged and prioritized uniformly from the organization's perspective. Meanwhile, the order of policy rules for each domain is retained. For example, for virus policy rules of a single domain, the original order will still be applied.

Policy rules can be reordered when they are sorted by **Order**. If they are sorted by another column heading, the reorder function is unavailable.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Do either of the following to reorder policy rules:

    - Click the up or down arrow button to move policy rules up or down.

    - Double-click the order number of a policy rule in the **Order** column and specify a new order number for the rule.

    Policy rules will be reordered as you configured, and email messages will be scanned based on the new rule order.
