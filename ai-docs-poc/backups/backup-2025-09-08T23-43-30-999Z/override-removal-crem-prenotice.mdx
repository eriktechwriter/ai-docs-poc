March 25, 2025â€”The current feature allowing users to override the number of assessed desktops, servers, and cloud accounts will be disabled on April 1. If you are are currently using the override feature, your credits will continue to be calculated according to the asset override total until May 1. During that time, add the desktops or servers you don't wish to assess to the Exception List in Attack Surface Discovery. For cloud accounts you don't wish to assess, disable Cyber Risk Exposure Management for the account in Cloud Accounts. After May 1, your credit requirements will be based on the actual number of discovered assets that have not been added to the Exception List or for which Cyber Risk Exposure Management is enabled. Contact your sales representative if you have any questions.
