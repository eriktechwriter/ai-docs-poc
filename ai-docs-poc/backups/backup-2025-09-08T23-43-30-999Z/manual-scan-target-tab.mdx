### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **Files to Scan** section, select from the following:

    - **All scannable files**: Includes all scannable files. Unscannable files are password protected files, encrypted files, or files that exceed the user-defined scanning restrictions.

      :::note

      Scanning every file requires a lot of time and resources and might be redundant in some situations. Therefore, you might want to limit the amount of files the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent includes in the scan.
      :::

    - **Scan only Mach-O files**: Only scan Mach-O files on endpoints. Apex One (Mac) Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents do not scan other file types for malware.

      :::note

      If you select this option, you must enable the smart scan feature to ensure protection against the latest malware attacks targeting OS X and macOS platforms.
      :::

2.  Under **Scan Settings**, select one or more from the following options:

    - **Scan compressed files**: Scan individual files within an archive file

      For more information, see [Supported Compressed File Types](supported-compressed-file-types.mdx).

    - **Scan network drive**: Scan directories physically located on other endpoints, but mapped to the local endpoint

    - **Scan Time Machine**: Only scan files on Time Machine drives

      :::note

      After enabling the **Scan Time Machine** option for Manual and Scheduled Scan, Apex One (Mac) can only detect malware threats but not take any action (clean, quarantine, or delete) due to a permission limitation in Mac OS. Configured scan actions display as unsuccessful in the product logs.
      :::

3.  In the **CPU Usage** section, configure the required settings.

    - **High**: No pausing between scans

    - **Low**: Pause between file scans if CPU consumption is higher than 20%, and do not pause if 20% or lower
