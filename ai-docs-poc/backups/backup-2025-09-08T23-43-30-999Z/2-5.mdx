Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

etcd should be configured for peer authentication.

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster.

:::note

This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.
:::

:::note

By default, `--peer-client-cert-auth` argument is set to `false`.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

All peers attempting to communicate with the etcd server will require a valid client certificate for authentication.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the etcd server node:

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep etcd
```

Verify that the `--peer-client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter.

``` codeblock
--peer-client-cert-auth=true
```
