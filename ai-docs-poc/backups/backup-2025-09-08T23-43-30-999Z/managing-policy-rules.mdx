Policy rules are the means by which messaging policies are applied to message traffic in Cloud Email Gateway Protection. At any time, administrators can see the policy rules that apply to their organizations, and make changes to the policy rules that comprise their policy, rename the policy rules, query the policy rules, reorder the policy rules, and create new policy rules. Each policy rule can be disabled if desired without losing its definition, and re-enabled at a later time.

<p>A new policy rule may be similar to the one you already have. In this case, it is easier to copy the policy rule and edit it rather than create a new policy rule from scratch.</p>
