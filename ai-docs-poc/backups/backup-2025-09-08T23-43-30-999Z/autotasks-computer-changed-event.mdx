Event-based tasks let you monitor protected computers for specific events and perform tasks based on certain conditions.

### Create an event-based task {#create-an-event-based-task}

In Server & Workload Protection, click **Administration → Event-Based Tasks → New**. The wizard that appears will guide you through the steps of creating a new task. You will be prompted for different information depending on the type of task.

### Edit or stop an existing event-based task {#edit-or-stop-an-existing-event-based-task}

To change the properties for an existing event-based task, go to click **Administration → Event-Based Tasks**. Select the event-based task from the list and click *Properties*.

### Events that you can monitor {#events-that-you-can-monitor}

- *Computer Created (by System):* A computer being added to the manager during synchronization with an Active Directory or Cloud Provider account.
- \*\*Computer Moved (by System):\*\*A virtual machine being moved from one vApp to another within the same ESXi, or a virtual machine on an ESXi being move from one datacenter to another or from one ESXi to another (including from an unmanaged ESXi server to a managed ESXi server running a virtual appliance.)
- *Agent-Initiated Activation:* An agent is activated using agent-initiated activation.
- *IP Address Changed:* A computer has begun using a different IP.

### Conditions {#conditions}

You can require specific match conditions to be met in order for a task to be carried out. For example, you might require an AWS 'tag' of `ProductionSystem` to be present in an Amazon EC2 instance in order for the *Activate Computer* action (see Actions, below) to occur on it.

When adding conditions:

- Click the "plus" button to add multiple conditions. In a multi-condition setup, ALL conditions must be met for the action to be carried out.
- Use Java regular expression syntax (regex). Some examples of how to use regex are provided in the table below. For details on regex, see[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.mdx).

### List of conditions and descriptions of each {#list-of-conditions-and-descriptions-of-each}

- *Cloud Instance Image ID*: AWS cloud instance AMI ID.

  :::note

  This match condition is only available for AWS cloud instances.
  :::

- *Cloud Instance Metadata:* The metadata being matched corresponds to [AWS tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.mdx), [Azure tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources), or [GCP labels](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources) that have been added to your AWS, Azure, or GCP instances.

  :::note

  This match condition is only available for AWS instances, Azure VMs, and GCP VMs added to the manager through **Computers → Add →** \[*Add AWS Account*, *Add Azure Account*, or *Add GCP Account*\]. Metadata currently associated with a computer is displayed on the *Overview* page in its editor window. To define the conditions to match for, you must provide two pieces of information: the metadata key and the metadata value. For example, to match a computer that has a metadata key named "*AlphaFunction*" that has a value of "*DServer*", you would enter "*AlphaFunction*" and "*DServer*" (without the quotes). If you wanted to match more than one possible condition, you could use regular expressions and enter "*AlphaFunction*" and "*.\*Server*", or "*AlphaFunction*" and "*D.\**".
  :::

- *Cloud Instance Security Group Name*: The security group the cloud instance applies to.

  :::note

  This match condition is only available for AWS cloud instances.
  :::

- *Cloud Account Name*: The "Display Name" field in the Cloud Account properties window.

- *Cloud Vendor*: The cloud environment vendor of the instance. This condition is used to match on instances from a specific cloud vendor.

  :::note

  *Cloud Vendor* only works if you added your cloud instances to the manager through **Computers → Add →** \[*Add AWS Account* , *Add Azure Account*, or *Add GCP Account*\].
  :::

- *Computer Name*: The "Hostname" field in the computer properties window.

- *GCP Network Tag*: [Network tags](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags) that have been added to GCP VMs.

  :::note

  If the GCP VM has multiple GCP network tags, and a match is found on any one of them, the VM is considered as matched.
  :::

- *Platform*: The operating system of the computer.

:::note

Depending on the source of the new computer, some fields may not be available. For example, "Platform" would not be available for computers added as a result of the synchronization with an Active Directory.

### Actions {#actions}

The following actions can be taken depending on which of the above events is detected:

- *Activate Computer:* Server & Workload Protection protection is activated on the computer.
  - *Delay activation by (minutes):* Activation is delayed by a specified number of minutes.
- \*\*Deactivate Computer:\*\*Server & Workload Protection protection is deactivated on the computer.
- *Assign Policy:* The new computer is automatically assigned a policy. (The computer must be activated first.)
- *Assign Relay Group:* The new computer is automatically assigned a relay group from which to receive security updates.
- *Assign to Computer Group:* The computer is placed in one of the computer groups on the Computers page.

### Order of execution {#order-of-execution}

When using event based tasks, you should create and use conditions that are unique to each task. This is because when identical conditions are encountered, Server & Workload Protection will process them in a specific order, and this order does not take into account the number of conditions within a task to rank said tasks against each other.

For example, if the server01.example.com computer on a Windows Server 2012 platform encountered the following event-based tasks:

![](/images/event-based-tasks=5a1aece4-04a3-4e9f-a860-84523238d3dc.webp)

The event-based task with more conditions is not automatically executed first. Instead, the "Platform" condition is matched twice, and the event-based tasks are executed based on the name of the task.

To avoid unexpected results, use a specific naming convention for your event-based tasks, such as CamelCase.

### Temporarily disable an event-based task {#temporarily-disable-an-event-based-task}

To prevent an existing event-based task from running, right-click it and then click *Disable* . For example, you may want to temporarily disable an event-based task while you perform certain administrative duties during which you don't want any activity to occur.

To re-enable an event-based task, right-click it and then click *Enable*.
