Implementing a load balancer for your Trend Vision One File Security Containerized Scanner provides several benefits:

- High Availability: Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple scanner instances, ensuring service continuity even if individual pods fail.
- Scalability: You can scale your scanner deployments while maintaining a single endpoint for clients.
- External Access: Load balancers provide a consistent external endpoint for ICAP clients outside your Kubernetes cluster.
- Traffic Management: You control how requests are distributed (for example round-robin, least connections) to optimize resource utilization.

### Deployment Options {#deployment-options}

Trend has tested two deployment options:

- [AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)](expose-icap-service-aws-nlb.mdx):
  - Ideal for EKS deployments

  - Layer 4 (TCP) load balancing

  - Handles millions of requests per second

  - Preserves client source IP addresses

  - Optional TLS termination for enhanced security
- [MetalLB](expose-icap-service-metallb.mdx):
  - Ideal for on-premises or self-managed Kubernetes clusters

  - Works where cloud load balancers aren't available

  - Provides true LoadBalancer services in bare-metal environments

  - Simple configuration with IP address pool allocation

  - Compatible with existing network infrastructure
