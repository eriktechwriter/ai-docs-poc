Server & Workload Protection supports the use of AWS Config Rules to query the status of your AWS instances. This can be especially useful if you want to have a centralized view into whether your instances meet certain compliance requirements.

There are four Lambda functions available from the Deep Security [AWS Config Rules Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/deep-security/aws-config):

- `ds-IsInstanceProtectedByAntiMalware` checks whether the current instance is protected by the Server & Workload Protection Anti-Malware module.
- `ds-IsInstanceProtectedBy` checks whether the current instance is protected by any of the Server & Workload Protection protection modules. This is a generic version of `ds-IsInstanceProtectedByAntiMalware`.
- `ds-DoesInstanceHavePolicy` checks whether the current instance is protected by a specific Server & Workload Protection policy.
- `ds-IsInstanceClear` checks whether the current instance has any warnings, alerts, or errors in Server & Workload Protection.

For more information about AWS Config, see the [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) section of the Amazon AWS website.
