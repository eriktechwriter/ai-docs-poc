Review information and requirements for enabling central management of your Deep Discovery Inspector resources and exceptions.

:::warning[Important]

Central management of network resources and detection exceptions only supports Deep Discovery Inspector appliance version 6.7 or later. There are some limitations when disabling central management for Deep Discovery Inspector appliance versions 6.7 or later.
:::

With Network Security, you can enable central management of **Network Resources** and **Detection Exceptions** for your connected Deep Discovery Inspector appliances. Enabling this feature impacts the availability of features on your connected appliances.

Review the following before enabling the feature:

- Before enabling central management, export and back up your settings in **Network Groups and Assets** and **Detection Exceptions**. Enabling central management overwrites the settings. Any currently configured settings are permanently lost and cannot be restored except by reimporting your backups.

- Central management for Network Resources and Detection Exceptions are enabled separately. Enabling one does not enable the other.

- Enabling central management applies the configured settings to all connected Deep Discovery Inspector appliances version 6.7 or later.

- Network Security does not currently support disabling the feature on specific appliances. Use the Import/Export feature to share settings with appliances if you do not want to sync all of your connected appliances.

- Enabling central management disables the features in the Deep Discovery Inspector appliance console. While enabled, you cannot configure the lists on your appliance console. You can still export the lists from the appliance console.

- Disabling central management does not restore the features in Deep Discovery Inspector appliance versions 6.7 or later. To restore the functions for **Network Groups and Assets** and **Detection Exceptions**, contact your support provider.
