View information on specific time-critical CVEs detected in your environment along with options for mitigation.

The detection of time-critical CVEs can indicate an ongoing zero-day attack or correspond with high-profile N-day vulnerabilities.

- Zero-day vulnerabilities have no patch when published, so the vulnerability can only be mitigated.

- N-day vulnerabilities have patches available when published, so the vulnerability can be mitigated or remediated if your operating system supports the patch.

Trend Micro recommends you address all time critical CVEs immediately to bolster your security posture. When a time-critical CVE is detected in your environment, Trend Vision One displays a security alert in the **Vulnerabilities** tab of **Cyber Risk Overview â†’ Exposure Overview**. Alerts display for 14 days and may involve one or more CVEs.

:::warning[Important]

To detect time-critical CVEs on endpoints, you must have the Trend Endpoint Agent deployed with Advanced Risk Telemetry enabled. Scans for time-critical CVEs occur hourly.
:::

The primary criteria for issuing a time-critical security alert include:

- High potential impact

- High likelihood of related exploit attempts

- Publicly available exploit code

To learn more about a detected time-critical CVE, including affected operating systems, available attack prevention/detection rules, and recommended mitigation or remediation options, click **View details** in the security alert. Trend Micro only issues time-critical security alerts for vulnerabilities with available mitigation options.

For high-profile N-day vulnerabilities, the CVE profile displays a summary including:

- The number of assessed devices in your environment

- How many assessed devices are affected by the vulnerability

- How many endpoints have been the target of exploit attempts related to the vulnerability

The following table details the information displayed on the profile screen of a time-critical CVE.
