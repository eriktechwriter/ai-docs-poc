November 15, 2024—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection enhances the access token re-creation process for Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Previously, access tokens can only be re-created using the same administrator of the current service account. Customers now are able to re-create access tokens with a different administrator, which is particularly useful when there are changes in team members.

To ensure that quarantined files can be managed by the new administrator, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also provides a guide to help customers transfer all existing quarantined files from the original administrator’s quarantine folder to the new administrator’s folder.
