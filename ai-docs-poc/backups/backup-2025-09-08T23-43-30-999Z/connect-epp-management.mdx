View endpoint groups within your connected endpoint security products.

Connected Endpoint Protection Management displays your connected Trend Micro endpoint security products and the managed endpoint groups. Connecting your Trend Micro endpoint security products with Trend Vision One provides better visibility by displaying all your connected endpoint protection products (both on-premises and SaaS) directly in the Endpoint Inventory screen. You can also access you product consoles directly from Endpoint Inventory.

You can view the endpoint group information for connected endpoint protection products or click **Open Console** to go to the sign-in screen for your product. You can also view endpoint policies for the following on-premises versions of Apex One and Deep Security:

- Apex Central Patch 6 B6511 (or later)

- Apex One On-Premises SP1 Patch 1: 12380 (or later)

- Apex One (Mac) Patch 10 3.5.7163 (or later)

- Deep Security Manager version 20.0.817 (or later)

You can evaluate the new Trend Vision One Endpoint Security by moving some of your agents from your connected endpoint protection products to Standard Endpoint Protection or Server & Workload Security. For more information, see [Evaluate Trend Vision One Endpoint Security](evaluate-endpoint-security.mdx).

You can also [update your connected endpoint protection products](update-endpoint-solutions.mdx) to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security.
