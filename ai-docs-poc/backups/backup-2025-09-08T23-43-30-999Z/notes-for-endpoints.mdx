You can manually add notes to endpoints to help track issues and solutions on particular endpoints. For example, add additional notes on isolated endpoints while you are investigating and resolving threats or when you are about to restore the network connection after all threats have been resolved.

Trend Micro Apex Central automatically adds the following notes corresponding to specific actions:

- "Isolate"

- "Restore"

- "Assign Tag {tag name}"

- "Remove Tag {tag name}"

For more information, see [Assigning Custom Tags to Users/Endpoints](assign-custom-tags-users-endpt.mdx) and [Isolating Endpoints](isolate-network-endpoints.mdx).
