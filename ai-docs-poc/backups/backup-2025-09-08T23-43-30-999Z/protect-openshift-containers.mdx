Red Hat OpenShift enables applications inside and outside Kubernetes clusters to run applications where it makes the most sense. OpenShift's basic security includes security hardening and FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) compliant encryption (FIPS 140-2 Level 1).

Once you have a secure foundation in place, adding Server & Workload Protection to your OpenShift deployment gives you access to Trend Microâ€™s extensive experience protecting physical, virtual, and cloud workloads as well as to real-time threat information from the [Trend Micro Smart Protection Network](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/technologies/smart-protection-network.mdx). Server & Workload Protection both protects your deployment as well as helps meet and maintain continuous compliance requirements.

Server & Workload Protection protects your OpenShift hosts and containers running on Red Hat Linux distributions. Server & Workload Protection can do the following:

- Identify, find, and protect OpenShift hosts within your deployment
- Provide [real-time anti-malware detection](enable-configure-anti-malware.mdx) for the file systems used on OpenShift hosts and within the containers

:::note

Communication between containers in the pod is not supported.
