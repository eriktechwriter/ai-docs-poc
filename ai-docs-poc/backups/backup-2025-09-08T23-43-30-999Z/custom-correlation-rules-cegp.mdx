January 13, 2025—Besides the Trend Micro predefined correlation rules, administrators can add custom correlation rules based on predefined detection signals to accommodate anomaly detection requirements in their environment. Administrators can apply custom correlation rules into the Correlated Intelligence policy and view details about detected anomalies in policy events logs. Furthermore, Cloud Email Gateway Protection offers flexibility by enabling administrators to select all or specific predefined correlation rules to detect suspicious emails and possibly unwanted emails.
