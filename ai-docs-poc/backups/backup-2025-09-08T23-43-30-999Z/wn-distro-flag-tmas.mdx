March 21, 2025—Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) now supports the new `--distro` flag, which allows you to specify OS distribution details for file and directory artifacts. This ensures accurate vulnerability matching for open-source RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) files that sometimes do not include OS information.

For more information, see the `WHATS-NEW.md` file included with the binary and the `--distro` flag information in [Artifact Scanner CLI](artifact-scanner-cli.mdx).
