::: {role="main"}
If you are using a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster or a cloud provider that does not support LoadBalancer services, you can use MetalLB to expose your ICAP service.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Install MetalLB in MicroK8s

    ``` codeblock
    # Enable MetalLB with an appropriate IP range for your network
    # Replace the IP range with one suitable for your network
    microk8s enable metallb:192.168.1.200-192.168.1.220
    ```

    :::note

    When choosing the IP range:

    - Ensure it is within your local subnet
    - Avoid conflicts with your DHCP server's range
    - Choose IPs that are not already assigned to other devices
    :::

2.  Update my-values.yaml with the following content:

    ``` codeblock
    scanner:
      # Other scanner settings remain unchanged
      externalService:
        enabled: true
        type: LoadBalancer  # This creates an NLB
        annotations: {}
        icapPort: 1344
    ```

3.  Update the deployment with MetalLB configuration:

    ``` codeblock
    Run the following:
    helm upgrade my-release visionone-filesecurity/visionone-filesecurity \
      -n visionone-filesecurity \
      -f my-values.yaml
    ```

4.  Verify the MetalLB deployment:

    ``` codeblock
    # Check the service status
    kubectl get service -n visionone-filesecurity | grep scanner-lb

    # Get the external IP assigned by MetalLB
    EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service -n visionone-filesecurity my-release-visionone-filesecurity-scanner-lb -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    echo "Your MetalLB external IP is: $EXTERNAL_IP"
    ```

5.  Install and use the c-icap-client to test your connection:

    ``` codeblock
    # Install c-icap-client
    sudo apt-get install c-icap

    # Test with file scanning
    c-icap-client -i $EXTERNAL_IP -s scan -p 1344 -f sample.txt -x "X-scan-file-name: sample.txt"
    ```
