:::: {role="main"}
Viruses often use real-time compression algorithms to attempt to circumvent virus filtering. The IntelliTrap feature blocks real-time compressed executable files and pairing them with other malware characteristics.

:::warning[Important]

Because IntelliTrap identifies such files as security risks and may incorrectly block safe files, consider quarantining (not deleting or cleaning) files when you enable IntelliTrap. (See [Customize malware remedial actions](customize-malware-remedial-actions.mdx).) If users regularly exchange real-time compressed executable files, disable IntelliTrap. IntelliTrap uses the virus scan engine, IntelliTrap Pattern, and IntelliTrap Exception Pattern.

For macOS agents, IntelliTrap is not supported.
