Avoid ClusterRoleBindings nor RoleBindings with the user `system:anonymous`.

Kubernetes assigns user `system:anonymous` to API server requests that have no authentication information provided. Binding a role to user` system:anonymous` gives any unauthenticated user the permissions granted by that role and is strongly discouraged.

:::note

No `clusterrolebindings` nor `rolebindings` with user `system:anonymous`.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

Unauthenticated users will have privileges and permissions associated with roles associated with the configured bindings.

Care should be taken before removing any `clusterrolebindings` or `rolebindings` from the environment to ensure they were not required for operation of the cluster. Use a more specific and authenticated user for cluster operations.

### Audit {#audit}

Both CusterRoleBindings and RoleBindings should be audited. Use the following command to confirm there are no `ClusterRoleBindings` to` system:anonymous`:

``` codeblock
$ kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o json | jq -r '["Name"], ["-----"], 
(.items[] | select((.subjects | length) > 0) | select(any(.subjects[]; .name 
== "system:anonymous")) | [.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name]) | @tsv'
```

There should be no `ClusterRoleBindings` listed. If any bindings exist, review their permissions with the following command and reassess their privilege:

``` codeblock
$ kubectl get clusterrolebinding [CLUSTER_ROLE_BINDING_NAME] -o json \ 
    | jq ' .roleRef.name +" " + .roleRef.kind' \ 
    | sed -e 's/"//g' \ 
    | xargs -l bash -c 'kubectl get $1 $0 -o yaml'
```

Confirm that there are no `RoleBindings` including the `system:anonymous` user:

``` codeblock
$ kubectl get rolebindings -A -o json \ 
     | jq -r '["Namespace", "Name"], ["---------", "-----"], (.items[] | 
select((.subjects | length) > 0) | select(any(.subjects[]; .name == 
"system:anonymous")) | [.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name]) | @tsv'
```

There should be no `RoleBindings` listed.

If any bindings exist, review their permissions with the following command and reassess their privilege.

``` codeblock
$ kubectl get rolebinding [ROLE_BINDING_NAME] --namespace 
[ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE] -o json \ 
    | jq ' .roleRef.name +" " + .roleRef.kind' \ 
    | sed -e 's/"//g' \ 
    | xargs -l bash -c 'kubectl get $1 $0 -o yaml --namespace 
[ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE]'
```

### Remediation {#remediation}

Identify all `clusterrolebindings` and `rolebindings` to the user system:anonymous.

Check if they are used and review the permissions associated with the binding using the commands in the Audit section above or refer to [GKE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/best-practices/rbac).

Strongly consider replacing unsafe bindings with an authenticated, user-defined group. Where possible, bind to non-default, user-defined groups with least-privilege roles. If there are any unsafe bindings to the user `system:anonymous`, proceed to delete them after consideration for cluster operations with only necessary, safer bindings.

``` codeblock
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding 
[CLUSTER_ROLE_BINDING_NAME] 
kubectl delete rolebinding 
[ROLE_BINDING_NAME] 
--namespace 
[ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE]
```
