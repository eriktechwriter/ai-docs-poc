### Import data through Text Import Wizard {#import-data-through-text-import-wizard}

Cloud Risk Management generated CSV report might contain special double-byte characters. Excel cannot display these characters if you open the file directly with Excel. This is an Excel limitation. Microsoft recommends to import file with UTF-8 encoding instead of opening directly. The following steps allow you to import data with `UTF-8` encoding so it can display the double-byte characters correctly.

1.  Create a workbook and go to *Data* tab \> From Text to launch the *Text Import Wizard*.

2.  From *Text Import Wizard*, select the *File origin* as: *Unicode (UTF-8)*

3.  *Finish* Text Import Wizard. The data from CSV file can be loaded correctly in Excel workbook.

### Get Reports using API {#get-reports-using-api}

You can download all reports generated for your Cloud Risk Management account using our [Reports API](https://github.com/cloudconformity/documentation-api/blob/master/reports-cloud-posture.xml) based on your role and permissions.
