Scan your cloud assets and accounts against the most common standards and frameworks using Cloud Risk Management Assessment.

You can always find your previous assessment reports by clicking **Assessment History** on the **Cyber Risk Assessment** screen.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Assessment → Cyber Risk Assessment**.

2.  In the **Cloud Risk Management Assessment** area, click **Start Assessment**.

3.  Run the Cloud Risk Management Assessment.

    - If you do not have any cloud accounts available in [Cloud Accounts](cloud-accounts.mdx), click **Add Cloud Account**, follow the prompts to onboard an [AWS account](aws-accounts.mdx) or connect an [Azure subscription](azure-subscriptions.mdx) or [Google Cloud project](google-cloud-projects.mdx) through the Cloud Accounts app. Then click **Finish**.

    - If you have already added cloud accounts, select a connected cloud account from the list and click **Start Assessment**.

      :::note

      You can assess only one cloud account at a time.

4.  Wait until your cloud account finishes the assessment.

    You will receive an email notification when the assessment is complete. Click the link in the notification to access the Trend Vision One console, and click **View Report** in the **Cloud Risk Management Assessment** area.

5.  Check the results on the assessment report and take risk remediation actions immediately if necessary.
