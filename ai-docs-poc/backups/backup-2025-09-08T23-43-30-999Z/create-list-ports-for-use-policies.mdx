::::: {role="main"}
Create lists of port numbers so that you can use them in multiple rules. A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each created in a different rule.

:::tip

To create a port list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it.
:::

Individual ports and port ranges can be included on the list, for example 80, and 20-21. You can insert comments into your port list by preceding the text with a pound sign ("#").

:::note

For a listing commonly accepted port number assignments, see the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml). For a list of port numbers used by Server & Workload Protection, relay, or agents, see [Server & Workload Protection Port numbers](swp-port-numbers.mdx).
