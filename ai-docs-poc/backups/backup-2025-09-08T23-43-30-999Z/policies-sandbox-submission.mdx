Configure and manage the Sandbox Submission module settings.

:::warning[Important]

- Policies and Sandbox Submission are "Pre-release" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- These features are not available in all regions.

- Enabling Sandbox Submission requires allocating credits for each endpoint assigned to the policy. Objects submitted by Sandbox Submission do not count towards the daily reserve set in Sandbox Analysis.

- Sandbox Submission supports Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents deployments with Standard Endpoint Protection.

- Navigating between the security modules or leaving the **Policy Settings** screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click **Save** before leaving the current screen.
:::

Sandbox Submission allows agents to automatically submit suspicious objects for analysis in a secure, isolated cloud sandbox environment. You can view analysis results in [Sandbox Analysis](sandbox-analysis.mdx).

To allow agents to submit suspicious objects for analysis, select **Enable**.
