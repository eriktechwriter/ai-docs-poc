Add your Alibaba Cloud accounts to provide visibility into your cloud environment.

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with sufficient privileges for the account you wish to connect. For best results, sign into the account on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. Review the [region limitations](alibaba-cloud-supported-regions.mdx) to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources.

Once you are ready, [connect your Alibaba Cloud account](adding-alibaba-cloud-account.mdx).
