Integrate with OpenLDAP to authenticate user access attempts and take action on risky account activity.

OpenLDAP integration requires the use of a Service Gateway, third-party integration settings, and SSO.

:::warning[Important]

You cannot configure single sign-on (SSO) from multiple IAMs. Ensure that you configure the necessary permissions and SSO on the IAM you want to use for Private Access and Internet Access authentication.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Prepare a [VMware ESXi](sg-virtual-app-vmware-esxi.mdx) or [Microsoft Hyper-V](deploy-virtual-appliance-ms-hyper-v.mdx) Service Gateway appliance that connects to your on-premises OpenLDAP server.

2.  Go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Identity and Access Management**.

3.  Connect your OpenLDAP server to Trend Vision One by [configuring OpenLDAP integration](openldap-integration.mdx).

4.  Integrate your LDAP service with a SAML-based SSO solution like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Microsoft Entra ID, or Okta.
