::: {role="main"}
You can delete an outbound static pair if you want. The generated pair can be recovered and used within 48 hours of the deletion. If you decide to re-use the pair, the region must be the same, but the bandwidth or type of traffic can be changed. If you choose to re-enable outbound static IP settings after 48 hours, you cannot regenerate the original static IP address pair. All traffic forwarding settings are also deleted.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To delete the provisioned static IP address pair, click the delete (![](/images/delete_connector=3fc07446-32b8-4304-a62e-6c9ecc08d84f.webp)) icon.

2.  Click **Save**.
