Integrate Mobile Security with an MDM solution that supports managed configuration to enroll your devices for security protection.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the Trend Vision One console, access the configuration screen for integration with other MDMs.

    - If this is the first time you set up Mobile Security, go to **Mobile Security → Mobile Inventory** to display the **Mobile Security** landing page.

      Under **I have an MDM solution**, choose **Use My MDM Solution → Other MDM Solution**.

    - If you have already set up an MDM integration or Mobile Device Director, go to **Mobile Security → Mobile Inventory**, click the settings icon (![](/images/integrationSettings=20250121101015.webp)), and click **Add MDM Solution**.

      Under **I have an MDM solution**, choose **Use My MDM Solution → Other MDM Solution**.

    The configuration screen appears.

    :::note

    Only administrators with the Master Administrator or Operator role can edit the integration settings.

2.  In the **Enrollment** section, follow the onscreen guide to enable the Mobile Security for Business app and create an app configuration policy for Mobile Security for Business in your MDM solution.

    :::note

    - The specific operations vary from MDM to MDM. This guide uses Ivanti as an example to illustrate the operations. For details, see [Managed configuration for Ivanti (MobileIron)](managed-config-ivanti-mobileiron.mdx).

    - The enrollment key for enrolling devices from an MDM is valid only for the time period specified in screen. Click **Regenerate** to generate a new enrollment key when necessary. Select **Send email notification x days before enrollment key expiration** to get notified of enrollment key expiration.
    :::

3.  Click **Advanced Settings** and set a schedule to re-calculate memberships for assignment groups of the "Dynamic devices" type.

4.  Click **Save Other MDM Solution X Settings**.
