June 23, 2025—Workbench can now automatically associate Threat Intelligence Sweeping alerts with Workbench insights to enhance your investigations. You can also manually add these alerts to insights when you identify relevant connections. The associated Threat Intelligence Sweeping alerts enrich the insights by providing additional indicators of compromise and threat context directly within your insights.

With this feature, you can have more streamlined and comprehensive investigations into potential security incidents.
