Trend Micro stops issuing security patches for Service Gateway 2.0 after the version 3.0 release. If you are still managing Service Gateway 2.0 appliances, upgrade the appliances to the latest version for continued service and security. For more information about 2.0 to 3.0 upgrade, see [Upgrading from Service Gateway 2.0 to 3.0](upgrading-service-gateway-2-3.mdx).
