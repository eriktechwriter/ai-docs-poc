Data Loss Prevention monitors data transmitted outside the host computer.

:::note

Trend Micro recommends choosing this scope for external agents.
:::

If you do not want to monitor data transmissions to certain targets outside the host computer, define the following:

- **Non-monitored targets**: Data Loss Prevention does not monitor data transmitted to these targets.

  :::note

  Data transmissions to non-monitored targets and to monitored targets where "Monitor" is the action are similar in that the transmission is allowed. The only difference is that for non-monitored targets, Data Loss Prevention does not log the transmission, whereas for monitored targets, the transmission is always logged.
  :::

- **Monitored targets**: These are specific targets within the non-monitored targets that should be monitored. Monitored targets are:

  - Optional if you defined non-monitored targets.

  - Not configurable if you did not define non-monitored targets.

For example:

The following IP addresses are assigned to your company's Legal Department:

- `10.201.168.1` to `10.201.168.25`

You are creating a policy that monitors the transmission of Employment Certificates to all employees except the Legal Department's full time staff. To do this, you would select **All transmissions** as the transmission scope and then:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 80%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><p>Option</p></th>
<th><p>Steps</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Option 1</p></td>
<td><ol>
<li><p>Add <code>10.201.168.1</code>-<code>10.201.168.25</code> to the non-monitored targets.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the IP addresses of the Legal Department's part-time staff to the monitored targets. Assume that there are 3 IP addresses, <code>10.201.168.21</code>-<code>10.201.168.23</code>.</p></li>
</ol></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Option 2</p></td>
<td><p>Add the IP addresses of the Legal Department's full time staff to the non-monitored targets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>10.201.168.1</code>-<code>10.201.168.20</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>10.201.168.24</code>-<code>10.201.168.25</code></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
