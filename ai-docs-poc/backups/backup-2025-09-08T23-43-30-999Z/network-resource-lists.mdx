Configure your Network Resource Lists to define your network topography for your connected Network Sensors.

Network Resources utilizes a set of lists to help define your network topography. These lists are used by Network Analytics to deliver more accurate reports and Workbench Alerts.

Each list provides a specific function and is synchronized across all connected appliances and supported products. You can take the following actions in each list:

- Click **Add** to add new entries one at a time.

- Click **Import** to upload a file containing entries. Supported formats depends on the list type. Importing overwrites the entries on a list.

- Click **Export** to download the list as a file. Supported formats depends on the list type.

- Select one or more entries and click **Delete** to remove them.

- For **Network Group List**, click the options icon (![](/images/vertical_ellipsis_icon=GUID-20230329141212.webp)) to add a subgroup or delete the selected group.

:::warning[Important]

**Network Resources** is called Network Assets in Deep Discovery Director and Deep Discovery Inspector. The names of some lists have also changed. Review the following table for more details.

:::note

When you connect your Deep Discovery Inspector appliances to **Network Inventory** through Deep Discovery Director, go to the Deep Discovery Director management console to configure the corresponding settings.
