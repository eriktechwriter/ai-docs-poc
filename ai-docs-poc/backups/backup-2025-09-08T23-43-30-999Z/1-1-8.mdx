Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The `etcd` pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. `etcd` is a highly- available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
