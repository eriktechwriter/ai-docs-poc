Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate user access attempts and take action on risky account activity.

:::warning[Important]

You cannot configure single sign-on (SSO) from multiple IAMs. Ensure that you configure the necessary permissions and SSO on the IAM you want to use for Private Access and Internet Access authentication.

**Threat and Exposure Management** and **Zero Trust Secure Access** both require data upload permission to ensure certain features function properly. Revoking data upload permission may prevent secure access policy enforcement and risk analysis.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Identity and Access Management**.

2.  To take direct action on risky accounts and authenticate Private Access and Internet Access rules, grant necessary permissions in the **Third-Party Integration** app.

    2.  Locate one or multiple Microsoft Entra ID tenants that you want to grant the "Read directory data and perform account management actions" permissions on, and then click **Grant permissions** in the **Status** column for **Zero Trust Secure Access**.

    3.  Follow the onscreen instructions to enable the data connection.

    4.  Switch back to the **Zero Trust Secure Access** browser tab.

3.  To configure risk control rules, you must also grant data upload permission for [Configure Microsoft Entra ID](configuring-saml-ad.mdx) in **Threat and Exposure Management → Data source**.

    1.  Go to the **Data Source** panel in **Threat and Exposure Management** by clicking **Data Source** in the information that displays when you hover over ![](/images/infoIcon=5ca285cd-10f2-43bc-bcd6-147fcbd4db5a.webp) in the **Data upload permission status** column.

    2.  If the required Microsoft Entra ID permissions are not granted yet, click **Manage permissions and integration settings in Third-Party Integration** to open the **Microsoft Entra ID** screen of the **Third-Party Integration** app.

    3.  Locate the Microsoft Entra ID tenants that you want to grant permissions on, and then click **Grant permissions** in the **Status** column for **Cyber Risk Exposure Management**.

    4.  Switch back to the Microsoft Entra ID **Data Source** panel and turn on **Data upload permission**.

    5.  Switch back to the **Zero Trust Secure Access** browser tab.
