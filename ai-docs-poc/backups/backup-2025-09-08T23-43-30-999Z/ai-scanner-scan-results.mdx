Evaluate the results of scans of your AI models.

The following table displays the information available in AI Scanner after a scan completes:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Scan details</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Basic information on your target AI model and the start time and duration of the scan.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Severity breakdown</strong></p></td>
<td><p>An overview of the severity levels of successful attacks on your AI model, organized into <strong>Critical</strong>, <strong>High</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong> severity levels.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Top attack objectives</strong></p></td>
<td><p>A chart displaying the most commonly used attack objectives targeting your AI model.</p>
<p>An attack objective is the outcome that an attack on an AI model attempts to produce, such as the disclosure of sensitive data.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Top attack techniques</strong></p></td>
<td><p>A chart displaying the most common techniques used to attack your AI model, such as DAN (Do Anything Now) prompts.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Framework compliance</strong></p></td>
<td><p>A chart of the percentage of scans in which your model demonstrated compliance with various global compliance standards, including the following:</p>
