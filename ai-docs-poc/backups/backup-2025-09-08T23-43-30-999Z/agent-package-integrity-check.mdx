Server & Workload Protection verifies the signature on the agent to ensure that the software files have not changed since the time of signing. An integrity check occurs when:

1.  You're upgrading the agent.
2.  You're enabling a new security module so the kernel support is being updated. If the validation fails, plugin installations and agent upgrades are blocked.
