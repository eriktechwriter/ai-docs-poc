:::: {role="main"}
Profile Applicability: Level 2

Kubernetes provides a default namespace, where objects are placed if no namespace is specified for them. Placing objects in this namespace makes application of RBAC and other controls more difficult.

Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to manage resources.

:::note

Unless a namespace is specific on object creation, the `default` namespace will be used.
:::

### Audit {#audit}

Run this command to list objects in default namespace:

``` codeblock
kubectl get all -n default
```

The only entries there should be system managed resources such as the `kubernetes` service.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.
