Pay-as-you-go billing offers a convenient, consumption-based option for accessing supported Trend Vision One features.

Pay-as-you-go enables you to use Trend Vision One features without needing to estimate your usage in advance or modify your credit allocation later. Based on the rates in your pay-as-you-go contract, you are only billed for the amount that you use. Start using pay-as-you-go in three simple steps.

Step 1: Purchase a pay-as-you-go contract

On the **Pay-as-you-go** tab, click **Purchase a contract in AWS** to purchase a pay-as-you-go contract from [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-u2in6sa3igl7c?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa). For more information, see [Purchase a pay-as-you-go contract from AWS Marketplace](purchasing-payg-contract-aws.mdx).

Step 2: Activate your contract

Click the link in your activation email and follow the instructions to activate your pay-as-you-go contract. Your contract might take some time to activate.

Step 3: Switch supported features to pay-as-you-go

You can switch the following Trend Vision One features' billing model from credit-based licensing to pay-as-you-go:

- Cyber Risk Exposure Management - Cloud account assessment

- Container Security

- File Security

- Endpoint Security - Advanced Server & Workload Protection

  :::tip

  Pay-as-you-go billing for Advanced Server & Workload Protection depends on which **Endpoint Security** features and modules you enable. For more information, see [How does credit allocation work for Server & Workload Protection?](credit-allocation-swp.mdx) and [How is pay-as-you-go billing calculated for Endpoint Security Advanced Server & Workload Protection?](payg-faqs-section.mdx).

:::warning[Important]

You can change the billing model of each feature once every 30 days. Once you change the billing model of a feature, you must wait 30 days to change the billing model back.
