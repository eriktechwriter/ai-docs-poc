The **Recipient Number** criteria allows you to create policy rules that take actions on messages based on the number of recipients the message is addressed to.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Scanning Criteria** tab, click **Advanced**.

2.  Select "**Any Match**".

    The **Attachment is** "**password protected**", **Attachment contains** "**active content**", and **Recipient number** criteria become available.

3.  Select **Recipient number**.

4.  Select **\>** or **\<=** from the comparison drop-down list.

    - Select **\>** to apply the policy rule to messages that are sent to more than the specified number of recipients.

    - Select **\<=** to apply the policy rule to messages that have the same number or fewer than the specified number of recipients.

    For example:

    **\> 10** applies the policy rule to all messages that have more than 10 recipients.

    **\<= 10** applies the policy rule to all messages that have 10 or fewer recipients.

5.  Type a value for the number of recipients.
