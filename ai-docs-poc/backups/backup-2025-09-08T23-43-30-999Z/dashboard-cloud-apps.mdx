Monitor your network integrity with the dashboard.

Each management console user account has an independent dashboard. Changes made to one user account dashboard do not affect other user account dashboards.

View aggregated or separate service data if you have created more than one organization to administer your cloud services across your corporate network.

The following table outlines the tabs on the **Dashboard** screen.
