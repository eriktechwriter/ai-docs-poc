Enable Kubelet authentication using certificates.

The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests.

:::note

By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on each node:

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep kubelet
```

Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and is set to the location of the client certificate authority file.

If the `--client-ca-file` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that the file sets `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client certificate authority file.

### Remediation {#remediation}

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client CA file.

If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.

``` codeblock
--client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>
```

Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

``` codeblock
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```
