May 27, 2024—To facilitate a higher-level overview, the Exposure, Attack, and Security Configuration Overview tabs in Cyber Risk Overview have been simplified to display current risk levels and risk scores for each category. In Risk Overview, view each category's contribution to the Risk Index at a glance, and get additional information about contributing risk factors and events from Risk Event Overview. Go to the tab for each risk category to quickly view the category's current risk level, and see contributing risk factors to more quickly prioritize risk reduction actions.
