You can override the block and allow behavior dictated by the Smart Protection Network's assessments with your lists of URLs that you want to block or allow.

:::warning[Important]

The *Allowed* list takes precedence over the *Blocked* list. URLs that match entries in the *Allowed* list are not checked against the *Blocked* list.
