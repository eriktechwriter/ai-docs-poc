July 4, 2024—The Container Inventory app now features filter and search functions to streamline the process to locate container services within the table view. Additionally, Container Inventory has implemented a page view, making it easier to navigate the list. These features encompass K8S elements such as Clusters, Nodes, Pods, and Containers, as well as ECS components including Clusters, Services, Tasks, and Containers.
