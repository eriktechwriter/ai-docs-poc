The Cloud Risk Management Report (also known as "The Daily Report") is a daily report that shows all Rules run and Checks that have passed and failed for all accounts within the organization. This ensures that managers and administrators within an organization are updated daily on the compliance of the organization's accounts based on the [Five Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/) Cloud Risk Management automatically generates the Cloud Risk Management Report for each account in the organization. The report includes a summary of Checks performed, the compliance status, and a list of all Checks. The Cloud Risk Management Report also provides the option to "Resolve" all failing Checks following the [Check resolution workflow](failed-check-resolution.mdx).
