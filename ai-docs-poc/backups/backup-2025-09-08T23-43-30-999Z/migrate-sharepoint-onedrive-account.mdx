Microsoft is deprecating the MSOnline PowerShell module, used by Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection with Basic Authentication. The retirement starts in early April 2025 and ends in late May 2025. To ensure protection for new SharePoint Online sites and OneDrive users, please migrate your Delegate Account using Basic Authentication to a token-based Authorized Account for each service.

Potential impacts if you continue using Delegate Account include:

- New SharePoint Online site collections and new OneDrive users cannot be synchronized and protected if the Delegate Account is not a global admin.

- Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection cannot validate the updated password of the Delegate Account. If the password is changed, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will not be able to verify its correctness.
:::

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection now supports migrating the customers to a modern authentication based Authorized Account for protection. Trend Micro recommends that customers currently with a Delegate Account complete the migration as early as possible.

:::warning[Important]

Before migration to use token-based authentication is successful, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection continues to protect your SharePoint Online and OneDrive services by using the current basic authentication.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration → Service Account**, and then click **Migration Available** under **Status** of the SharePoint Online service account.

    The **Migrate to Use Authorized Account** screen appears.

    :::note

    If you have granted only access to the SharePoint Online service with a Delegate Account , the **Migrate to Use Authorized Account** screen shows a four-step procedure for migrating to use Authorized Account for SharePoint Online; if you have granted only access to the OneDrive service with a Delegate Account, the screen shows a three-step procedure for migrating to use Authorized Account for OneDrive; if you have granted access to both services with a Delegate Account, the screen shows the procedure for SharePoint Online first, and then the procedure for OneDrive after you complete the procedure for SharePoint Online.

    Here it is assumed that you have granted access to both services with a Delegate Account.

2.  Follow steps 4 through 6 in [Granting access to SharePoint Online with an authorized account](access-sharepoint-account.mdx).

3.  Go back to the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection management console and click **Next**.

    The message "Are you sure you have followed the instructions for step 2 to grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection permissions to receive notifications from Microsoft for real-time scanning on your SharePoint Online sites? Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection cannot receive notifications from Microsoft for real-time scanning on your SharePoint Online sites if you do not grant the permissions." appears.

4.  Click **Yes**.

    The **Migrate to Use Authorized Account** screen for the OneDrive service appears.

5.  Click **Click here** at the end of Step 1.

    The Microsoft logon screen appears.

6.  Follow steps 4 through 6 in [Granting access to OneDrive with an authorized account](grant-access-onedrive-authorized.mdx).

7.  Go back to the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection management console and click **Submit**.

    The message "Are you sure you have followed the instructions for step 2 to grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection permissions to receive notifications from Microsoft for real-time scanning on your OneDrive sites? Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection cannot receive notifications from Microsoft for real-time scanning on your OneDrive sites if you do not grant the permissions." appears.

8.  Click **Yes**.

    Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection then updates the SharePoint Online and OneDrive data in your organization. The time required depends on how much data you have in SharePoint Online and OneDrive.

9.  Click **Done**.

10. Hover over the task icon in the upper-right corner of the management console.

    If the message "Migrated to use Authorized Account for SharePoint Online" or "Migrated to use Authorized Account for OneDrive" appears, the migration is successful. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will protect your SharePoint Online and OneDrive services using token-based modern authentication through the created Authorized Account.

11. Click **Delegate Account Cleanup** under **Status** of the SharePoint Online or OneDrive service account, and click **Delegate Account cleanup for SharePoint Online** or **Delegate Account cleanup for OneDrive** to clean up the Delegate Account.

    :::note

    The **Delegate Account Cleanup** and **Delegate Account cleanup for SharePoint Online** (or **Delegate Account cleanup for OneDrive**) links are available only if the Delegate Account that you previously use is not assigned to the Global Administrator role.
    :::

12. On the **Delegate Account Cleanup** screen that appears, specify your Microsoft 365 Global Administrator credentials and click **Done** to clean up the Delegate Account.

13. (Optional) Delete the Delegate Account in your Microsoft 365 admin center.

    2.  Log on to your Microsoft 365 admin center.

    3.  Go to **Users → Active users**, and then locate and select the Delegate Account to delete the account.
