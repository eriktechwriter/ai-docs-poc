Problem: An error message indicating the failure to synchronize internal domains in scheduled user data synchronization for Gmail.

The possible reason is as follows:

This occurs if your organization started to use the Gmail protection functionality in public preview. During that stage, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection was not granted the domain read-only permission during access grant, and thus not able to synchronize the internal domains of your organization.

Perform either of the following:

- Remove the Gmail service account that you used in public preview, and grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Gmail again.

- Go to **Advanced Threat Protection → Internal Domains** or **Administration → Global Settings → Internal Domains** to manually add the internal domains of your organization. Repeat this every time there is a new domain created for your organization.
