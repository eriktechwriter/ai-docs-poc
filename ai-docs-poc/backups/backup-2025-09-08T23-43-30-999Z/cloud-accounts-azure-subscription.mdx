December 18, 2023—As a preview feature, Cloud Accounts now supports connecting Azure Subscriptions to Trend Vision One. Connecting your Azure Subscription allows Trend Vision One to discover your Azure cloud assets and rapidly identify risks such as compliance and security best practice violations on your cloud infrastructure. Once connected, cloud accounts and assets from your Azure subscriptions are visible in the Cloud Risk Management and Attack Surface Discovery apps under Cyber Risk Exposure Management. For more information, see [Adding an Azure subscription](adding-azure-subscription.mdx).
