You can investigate sensitive data alerts in Workbench to track and mitigate how sensitive data is shared and transmitted in your environment.

1.  In the **Workbench** app, go to **All Alerts**.

2.  From the **Data source/processer list** select **Data Detection and Response**.

3.  Click the Workbench ID for the alert you want to investigate.

4.  In the alert details screen, inspect and analyze the provided alert information. To investigate sensitive data, do any of the following:

    - In the **Highlights** area, view the **Sensitive data section** to see a list of files with sensitive data for that endpoint. If there are more than two files with sensitive data, click **View details** to view the entire list.

    - In the **Observable Graph** section, right-click a file node and select **View detailed profile** to view more information about the file, including data type and size and the full URI.

    - To track how the file has been transmitted or shared between endpoints, right-click the file node and select **Check Data Lineage** to view a graph depicting the file's movements. For more information, see [Data Lineage](data-lineage.mdx).

    For more information, see [Investigate an alert](investigating-alert.mdx).
