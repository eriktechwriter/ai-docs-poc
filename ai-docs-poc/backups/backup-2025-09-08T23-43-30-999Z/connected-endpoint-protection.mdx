August 7, 2023â€”Trend Vision One Endpoint Security provides better visibility by displaying all your connected endpoint protection products (both on-premises and SaaS) directly to the Endpoint Inventory screen and allows you direct linking to the related product consoles. You can also evaluate the new Endpoint Security protection by moving a subset of your agents from Trend Micro Apex One as a Service or Trend Cloud One Endpoint & Workload Security. After experiencing the single console benefits, you can update your SaaS offerings to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security.

You can also view endpoint policies for the following on-premises versions of Apex One and Deep Security.

- Apex Central Patch 6 (B6511 or later)

- Apex One SP1 Patch 1 (12380 or later)

- Apex One (Mac) Patch 10 (3.5.7163 or later)
