Reduce network congestion on your on-premises gateway by configuring bandwidth control.

Bandwidth control reduces network congestion by controlling communications, reducing unwanted traffic, and allowing critical traffic or services the appropriate bandwidth allocation.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **On-Premises Gateways** section, click **Configure Bandwidth Control**.

    The **Configure Bandwidth Control** screen appears.

2.  In the **Overall bandwidth settings** area, click **Configure overall bandwidth settings**.

3.  Click **On** and set the overall upstream and downstream bandwidths based on your organization's internet bandwidth settings.

4.  Click **Save**.

5.  Manage bandwidth control rules.
