Deploy your Virtual Network Sensor to your Azure cloud environment.

If your security environment uses a hybrid deployment, or you do not have VMware or Microsoft Hyper-V in your environment, you can leverage your Azure subscription to deploy a Virtual Network Sensor.

Before you begin, review the [Virtual Network Sensor system requirements](network-sensor-sys-reqs.mdx) and ensure you have a sign in with permission to deploy virtual machines on the target subscription.

To deploy the Virtual Network Sensor, you must complete the following steps:

1.  Choose or create a virtual network for the Virtual Network Sensor instance.

    For more information on how to create a virtual network, refer to the Azure documentation.

2.  Choose or [create the network security group and subnets](network-subnets-network-sensor.mdx) for the Virtual Network Sensor data port and management port.

    Trend Micro recommends using different subnets for the data and management ports.

3.  [Launch an instance](launching-network-sensor-azure.mdx) with the Virtual Network Sensor.

4.  Verify the Virtual Network Sensor can connect with Network Inventory.

    If the Virtual Network Sensor does not appear in Network Inventory after deployment, verify the following settings:

    - Network settings (NIC/vNIC setting and order)

    - Firewall settings

    - Proxy settings if using a proxy

    - Review the [Virtual Network Sensor FAQ](virtual-network-sensor-faqs.mdx) to verify and test the connection

5.  Configure the network settings for the Virtual Network Sensor.

    :::note

    Trend Micro recommends using Microsoft Azure virtual network TAP with Virtual Network Sensor. For more information, see [Setting up traffic mirroring with Azure virtual network TAP](azure-vtap-mirror.mdx).
    :::

6.  After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command `show traffic` to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic. For more information about troubleshooting, see [Virtual Network Sensor FAQ](virtual-network-sensor-faqs.mdx) and [Virtual Network Sensor CLI commands](virtual-network-sensor-cli-commands.mdx).
