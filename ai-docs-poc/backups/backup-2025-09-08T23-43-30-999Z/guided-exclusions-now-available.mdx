::: {role="main"}
March 24, 2025—Cloud Risk Exposure Management (CREM) users will now be able to exclude resources in use by all Trend Vision One products to avoid conflicts during rule scanning.

The **Guided Exclusions** option under Cloud Risk Management is enabled by default for all CREM customers with Agentless Vulnerability and Threat Detection for AWS resources and will no longer affect the compliance scores. You can include them by deselecting the default option.

For more information, see [Managing preferences](managing-preferences.mdx).
