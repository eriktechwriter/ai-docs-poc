Ensure that the kubelet service file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.

The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, the kubelet service file has permissions of 644.

### Audit {#audit}

Kubelet is run as a `systemd` unit and its configuration file is created with 644 permissions.

Run the following command:

``` codeblock
for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
       oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %a
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
done
```

Verify that the permissions are 644 or more restrictive.
