Configure a private access rule to control access to your organization's internal apps based on user, device, time, and location.

:::note

Trend Vision One automatically creates a default private access rule to apply whenever no other private access rules are matched. The default rule blocks all access to configured internal apps.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Secure Access Rules** screen, click the **Private Access** tab and then click **Create Rule**.

    The rule configuration screen appears with the *Internal app access* rule template selected.

2.  Specify a unique name and a description for the rule.

3.  (Optional) To enable or disable the rule, click the toggle next to **Status**.

    :::tip

    You can also enable or disable rules on the **Secure Access Rules** screen.
    :::

4.  Configure the following rule settings.

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 13%" />
    <col style="width: 25%" />
    <col style="width: 63%" />

    <td rowspan="3"><p>Source</p></td>
    <td rowspan="3"><p>The users, devices, and locations that the rule applies to</p></td>
    <td><p><strong>Users / User groups/ IP addresses</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Users / Groups/ IP address groups</strong>: Target or exclude users or groups registered with your configured SSO provider. You may alternatively target or exclude both public and private IP address groups.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Only users or groups from the IAM system configured as your SSO provider can be used in rules.</p></li>
    <li><p>Define a new IP address group by clicking <strong>Add</strong>, and select either a Public or Private IP address group. If you have selected Private IP address, the IP addresses or ranges must exist on your internal corporate network.</p></li>
    </ul>
    

    :::warning[Important]
    
    <p>Rules may not apply to devices without the Secure Access Module installed that do not send HTTP/HTTPS requests containing the <code>X-Forwarded-For (XFF)</code> header field. The Internet Access Gateway cannot retrieve the private IP addresses of these devices.</p>

    :::note
    
    <p>If you have configured more than one IAM system, the IAM system with SSO enabled applies.</p>
