Add or remove tagged assets associated with a given tag.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Choose a tag property and click the ![](/images/simulationsRightArrow=20220525102311.webp) icon to expand the list of associated tag values.

2.  After choosing a tag value, click the number of **Tagged assets** for a given asset type, or click **Manage assets**.

    The **Manage tagged assets** window appears.

    :::note

    If no assets appear in the window, you can use the **Asset type** filter to show any applicable assets.
    :::

3.  Assign the tag to assets.

    1.  Click **+ Assign to assets**.

        The **Assign tag to assets** window appears.

    2.  Select one or more assets from the list and click **Assign tag**.

    3.  Click **Assign** in the confirmation window.

        :::note

        For some platform tag properties, you can only assign one tag value to a given asset. For those tags, if another value of the same tag property is already assigned to one or more of the selected assets, click **Replace** in the confirmation window instead.

        By taking this action, you assign the new tag value to the selected assets. This action removes any other values of the same tag property from the assets.
        :::

4.  You can also remove the tag from existing tagged assets.

    1.  In the **Managed tagged assets** window, select one or more tagged assets.

    2.  Click **Remove tag**.

    3.  In the confirmation window, click **Remove**.

        :::note

        If you remove a tag from an asset with no other tags, the asset is reset to system-defined tag values.
