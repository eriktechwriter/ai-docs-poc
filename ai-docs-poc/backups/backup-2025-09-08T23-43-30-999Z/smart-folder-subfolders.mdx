Create sub-folders within your smart folders to narrow your searches.

:::note

To automatically create sub-folders for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, see [Automatically create sub-folders](automatically-create-subfolders.mdx).
:::

You can use sub-folders to filter a smart folder's search results. Smart folders can be nested up to 10 levels deep.

For example, you might have a smart folder for all your Windows computers, but want to focus on computers that are specifically Windows 7, and maybe specifically either 32-bit or 64-bit. To do this, under the Windows parent folder, you could create a child smart folder for Windows 7. Then, under the Windows 7 folder, you would create two child smart folders: 32-bit and 64-bit.
