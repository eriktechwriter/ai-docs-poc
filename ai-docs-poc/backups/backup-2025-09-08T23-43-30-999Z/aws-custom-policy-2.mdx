### Keeping your AWS Custom Policy up-to-date {#keeping-your-aws-custom-policy-up-to-date}

As Cloud Risk Management adds and updates rules, we may require an update to the custom policy you have set up on your AWS Account.

If you're using CloudFormation (or Automated account setup) for your AWS Custom Policy, you will be alerted if an update is required via the [Custom Policy Version rule](https://www.cloudconformity.com/conformity-rules/CloudConformity/custom-policy-version.mdx).

If you setup your AWS Custom Policy manually or a template tool other than CloudFormation (e.g. Terraform), keep an eye for the update via our news feed.
