February 24, 2025—The enhanced recommendation scan improves upon the classic recommendation scan by optimizing efficiency, reliability, and accuracy when identifying security rules for Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection. Based on your system's required security rules, the scan delivers recommendations with optimized performance and fewer limitations. Whether run manually or scheduled for automated scanning, enhanced recommendation scan can apply recommended rules for regular protection with minimal disruption and reduced strain on system resources.

For more information, see [Enhanced recommendation scan](enhanced-reco-scan.mdx).
