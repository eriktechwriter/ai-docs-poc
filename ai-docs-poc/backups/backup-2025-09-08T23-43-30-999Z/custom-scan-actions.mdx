<p>The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent then sends quarantined files to the designated quarantine directory, which is on the managing server by default.</p>
<p>The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent encrypts quarantined files sent to this directory.</p>

<td><p>Clean</p></td>
<td><p>Cleans the infected file before allowing full access to the file.</p>
<p>If the file is uncleanable, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions: "Quarantine", "Delete", "Rename", and "Pass".</p>
<p>This action can be performed on all types of security threats except probable virus/malware.</p>


:::note

<p>Some files are uncleanable. For details, see <a href="trend-vision-one-uncleanable-files">Uncleanable Files</a>.</p>
