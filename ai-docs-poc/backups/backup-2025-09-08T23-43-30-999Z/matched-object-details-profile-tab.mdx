The **Profile** tab shows the details applicable for the selected object type.

Some objects may show only a limited set of details, or may not have any details available at the time of execution.

:::note

You can further examine objects with "Malicious" ratings in Threat Connect or VirusTotal.

The tab may also display additional options for **Matched Objects** and **Noteworthy Objects**.

:::note

<p>If Application Control is enabled, processes that match the hash value of objects added to the <strong>User-Defined Suspicious Object</strong> list are not allowed to run on all endpoints. Endpoint Sensor also terminates "process" type objects before adding them to the list, and Application Control prevents them from starting again.</p>
