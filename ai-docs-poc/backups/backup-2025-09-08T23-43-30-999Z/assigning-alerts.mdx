:::: {role="main"}
Assign owners to your Workbench alerts so that your security team can track changes and receive notifications.

You can assign the following as owners of an alert:

- Users with a valid Trend Vision One account

- SAML groups

- SAML group members

- IdP-only SAML groups

- IdP-only SAML group members

You can assign multiple owners to one alert and you can assign owners to multiple alerts at once.

:::warning[Important]

Assigning owners has the following limitations:

- Adding new assignees overrides the current alert owners.

- For IdP-only SAML group users:

  - You can only assign users who have signed in and are still cached in Trend Vision One.

  - [User Accounts](user-accounts-foundation-services.mdx) cannot list all users under the IdP-only SAML group.

- *IdP-only SAML groups* and *IdP-only SAML group users* cannot get email notifications.
