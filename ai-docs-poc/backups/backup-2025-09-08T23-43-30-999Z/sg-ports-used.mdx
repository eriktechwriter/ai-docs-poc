Configure your firewall and connected products to allow inbound communication to the Service Gateway.

Use the following settings to configure your firewall or open the necessary ports on your virtual host to allow internal, inbound communication from connected products and third-party applications to the Service Gateway.

:::warning[Important]

These ports are strictly for internal network traffic and the Service Gateway does not require any external inbound ports to be opened.
