Real-time Scan is a persistent and ongoing scan. Each time a file is received, opened, downloaded, copied, or modified, Real-time Scan scans the file for security risks. If the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent does not detect a security risk, users can proceed to access the file. If the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent detects a security risk or a probable virus/malware, a notification message displays indicating the name of the infected file and the specific security risk.

Real-time Scan maintains a persistent scan cache which reloads each time the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent starts. The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent tracks any changes to files or folders that occurred since the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent unloaded and removes these files from the cache.
