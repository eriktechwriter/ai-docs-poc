Learn how to deploy your own Virtual Network Sensor on VMware vCenter.

Virtual Network Sensor is a lightweight network sensor that scans your network activity and feeds network activity data to Trend Vision One and allows you to discover unmanaged assets and gain a holistic view of your attack surface. Before using the features of **Network Security**, you need to set up your Virtual Network Sensor and connect your appliance to Trend Vision One.

:::warning[Important]

- If the throughput exceeds 2000 Mbps, Trend Micro recommends configuring your Virtual Network Sensor using a PCI passthrough that is compliant with the following drivers: Broadcom tg3 and bnxt_en, and Intel i40e, igb, ixgbe, and e1000.

- Review the [Virtual Network Sensor system requirements](network-sensor-sys-reqs.mdx) before starting and ensure you have adequate resources for the Virtual Network Sensor.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Network Security → Network Inventory → Virtual Network Sensor**.

2.  Click **Deploy Virtual Network Sensor**.

    The **Virtual Network Sensor Deployment** panel appears.

3.  Select **VMware vCenter (OVA)** for the platform.

4.  Select the **Connection method**.

    - **Direct connection**: the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One directly. Make sure the Virtual Network Sensor is able to connect to the internet when using this configuration.

    - **Connect using a custom proxy**: the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One through a third-party proxy. After choosing this method, configure the following fields:

      - **Proxy address**: Specify the IP address of the proxy.

      - **Proxy port**: Specify the connecting port of the proxy.

      - **Proxy server requires authentication**: (Optional) Select if the proxy requires authentication credentials.

      - **User name**: Specify the user name for the proxy credentials.

      - **Password**: Specify the password for the proxy credentials.

    - **Connect using a Service Gateway as proxy**: the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One through a Service Gateway. Select a Service Gateway to use for this method.

      :::warning[Important]

      The Virtual Network Sensor must be able to connect to a Service Gateway with the Forward Proxy Service configured and enabled. For more information, see [Manage services in Service Gateway](managing-services-service-gateway.mdx).

5.  Click **Download Disk Image**.

6.  In the VMware vCenter console, [configure network settings](vsphere-st-switch-promiscuous-rspan.mdx) to allow the Virtual Network Sensor to monitor data in VMware vCenter.

7.  Right-click the IP address for your server and select **Deploy OVF Template...**

8.  On the **Select an OVF template** screen, select **Local file** and click **UPLOAD FILES** to select the Virtual Network Sensor disk image.

9.  Click **NEXT**.

10. On the **Select a name and folder** screen, specify a **Virtual machine name** and select a location for the virtual machine.

11. Click **NEXT**.

12. On the **Select a compute resource** screen, select a resource that you want to deploy the virtual appliance to and click **NEXT**.

    :::note

    The default is the virtual machine you previously selected.
    :::

13. On the **Review details** screen, verify the template details and click **NEXT**.

14. On the **Configuration** screen, select the network throughput and click **NEXT**.

15. On the **Select storage** screen, select the destination storage for where the virtual machine resides and **Thick Provision Lazy Zeroed** for virtual disk format.

16. Click **NEXT**.

17. On the **Select networks** screen, select **VM Network** as the management network (NIC 1), and **Data Network** as the data network (NIC 2) and click **NEXT**.

    :::note

    The NIC you chose for the management network must be able to connect to the internet.
    :::

18. On the **Customize template** screen, specify the following settings:

    - Expand **System Settings**, select **1000** for the bandwidth, and enter the **Administrator password**.

    - Expand **Network Settings** and configure the settings.

      :::note

      The device name or FQDN may not include underlines.
      :::

    - Expand **Proxy Settings** and configure the settings.

19. Click **Next**.

20. On the **Ready to complete** screen, review your settings and click **FINISH**.

    Your Virtual Network Sensor deploys and automatically connects to Network Inventory.

21. To confirm that the Virtual Network Sensor has successfully deployed, open Network Inventory on the Trend Vision One console and view information about your deployed Virtual Network Sensor.

    If the Virtual Network Sensor does not appear in Network Inventory after deployment, verify the following settings:

    - Network settings (NIC/vNIC setting and order)

    - Firewall settings

    - Proxy settings if using a proxy

    - Review the [Virtual Network Sensor FAQ](virtual-network-sensor-faqs.mdx) to verify and test the connection

    :::note

    For information about troubleshooting the Virtual Network Sensor see [Virtual Network Sensor CLI commands](virtual-network-sensor-cli-commands.mdx).
