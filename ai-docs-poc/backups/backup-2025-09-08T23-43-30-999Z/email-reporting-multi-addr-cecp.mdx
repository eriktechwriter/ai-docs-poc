August 15, 2025—The **Report to administrator** option in email reporting settings now supports up to 10 email addresses in the current organization, an enhancement from the previous limit of one. This allows greater flexibility in notifying multiple stakeholders when emails are reported by end users, improving visibility and response coordination across teams.
