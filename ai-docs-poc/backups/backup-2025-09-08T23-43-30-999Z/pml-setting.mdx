Trend Micro Predictive Machine Learning uses advanced machine learning technology to correlate threat information and perform in-depth file analysis to detect emerging unknown security risks through digital DNA fingerprinting, API mapping, and other file features. Predictive Machine Learning also performs a behavioral analysis on unknown or low-prevalence processes to determine if an emerging or unknown threat is attempting to infect your network.

Predictive Machine Learning is a powerful tool that helps protect your environment from unidentified threats and zero-day attacks.

To enable this feature, select **Enable Predictive Machine Learning**.
