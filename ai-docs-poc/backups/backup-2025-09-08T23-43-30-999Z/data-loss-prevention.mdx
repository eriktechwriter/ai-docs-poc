Data Loss Prevention (DLP) safeguards an organization's confidential and sensitive data-referred to as digital assets-against accidental disclosure and intentional theft. DLP allows you to:

- Identify the digital assets to protect

- Create policies that limit or prevent the transmission of digital assets through common channels, such as email and external devices

- Enforce compliance to established privacy standards

DLP evaluates data against a set of rules defined in policies. Policies determine the data that must be protected from unauthorized transmission and the action that DLP performs when it detects transmission.

:::warning[Important]

Each managed product provides different policy settings that you can configure and deploy to policy targets. You can find a complete list of supported managed products and the policy settings for each in the Apex Central as a Service Widget and Policy Management Guide.

You can download a PDF version of the guide, or view the guide online, using the following link:
