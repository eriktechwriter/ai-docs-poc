November 20, 2023—Trend Vision One has traditionally discovered and assessed internet-facing assets via internal Trend Micro solutions. Trend Vision One now supports a new data source for internet-facing assets—Rescana. If you are a Rescana customer, you can easily enable the data source by specifying the correct URL and API token for your Rescana account. If you disable the Rescana integration, Trend Vision One resumes using Trend Micro internal solutions for collecting data on internet-facing assets.
