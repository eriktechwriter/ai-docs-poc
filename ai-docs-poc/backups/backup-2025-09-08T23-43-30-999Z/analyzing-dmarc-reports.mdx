Monitor the DMARC authentication trends and anomalies for your domains by using the DMARC Report Analysis feature

Enable DMARC Report Analysis to send DMARC reports to Cloud Email Gateway Protection for analysis. Get easily readable analysis results to monitor trends and identify anomalies in emails sent on behalf of your managed domains.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Outbound Protection → Domain-based Authentication → Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) Monitoring**.

2.  Go to **DMARC Report Analysis**.

3.  Check whether your have configured DMARC records for your domains to send DMARC reports to Cloud Email Gateway Protection by clicking **Reporting Configuration**.

    If you haven't, you can following the on-screen instructions to update your DMARC records.

    The Cloud Email Gateway Protection address for receiving DMARC reports is as follows for each serving site:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th><p>Serving Site</p></th>
    <th><p>Report Receiving Address</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p>North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific</p></td>
    <td><p>%company_identifier%@dmarcrua.tmes.trendmicro.com</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Europe and Africa</p></td>
    <td><p>%company_identifier%@dmarcrua.tmes.trendmicro.eu</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Australia and New Zealand</p></td>
    <td><p>%company_identifier%@dmarcrua.tmes-anz.trendmicro.com</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Japan</p></td>
    <td><p>%company_identifier%@dmarcrua.tmems-jp.trendmicro.com</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Singapore</p></td>
    <td><p>%company_identifier%@dmarcrua.tmes-sg.trendmicro.com</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>India</p></td>
    <td><p>%company_identifier%@dmarcrua.tmes-in.trendmicro.com</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Middle East (UAE)</p></td>
    <td><p>%company_identifier%@dmarcrua.tmes-uae.trendmicro.com</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    To generate a new DMARC record, you can use the built-in DMARC record generator by clicking **Generate DMARC Record** and following on-screen instructions.

    After your DMARC record is updated for DMARC reporting, you can click **Verify** to check whether the new DMARC record has taken effect.

    :::note

    You need to wait because DMARC record update takes some time to propagate across DNS servers.

4.  Check the DMARC report analysis results for your domains by clicking the other tabs under **DMARC Report Analysis**.

    Based on received DMARC reports, Cloud Email Gateway Protection generates results to show the DMARC compliance check results and more DMARC authentication details about emails sent on behalf of your domains.
