Grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Gmail (Inline Mode) to allow Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to run advanced threat protection and data loss prevention scanning in Inline Mode on email messages in protected Gmail mailboxes.

The steps outlined below detail how to grant access to Gmail (Inline Mode) from **Dashboard** for Inline Protection over inbound and outbound emails.

:::note

If you have granted access to Gmail (Inline Mode) for inbound protection using a Gmail (Inline Mode) - Inbound Protection service account, upgrade the service account to a Gmail (Inline Mode) service account to have outbound protection in addition to inbound protection:

Go to **Administration → Service Account**, locate your Gmail (Inline Mode) - Inbound Protection service account, click **Upgrade to Have Outbound Protection**, and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the procedure.

4.  Go back to the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection management console as instructed and grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection the permission on required APIs by clicking **Click here** in **Step 2**.

    For details, see [Configuring email routing for inline protection](email-routing-inline-prot.mdx).

8.  Wait until the process is completed.

    If the message "Successfully created a service account and synced data." appears on the screen, the access grant is successful.

    :::warning[Important]

    After the access grant is completed, enable the default Advanced Threat Protection policy and Data Loss Prevention policy or create custom policies for Gmail (Inline Mode). After you enable the policies, make sure you enable the rules **TMCAS Content Compliance Rule for Incoming Message** and **TMCAS Content Compliance Rule for Outgoing Message** in the Google Workspace Admin console.
    :::

    If for some reason the access token becomes invalid, a notification appears on **Dashboard**. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also sends an email message to notify the administrator of this event. To continue using the service account, go to **Administration → Service Account** to create a new access token. For more information, see [Service account](service-account-cloud-apps.mdx).
