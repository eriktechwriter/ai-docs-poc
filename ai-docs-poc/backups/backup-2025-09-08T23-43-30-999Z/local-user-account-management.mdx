Add users not connected with a third-party identity provider in order to allow authentication into Private Access and Internet Access services.

:::warning[Important]

This feature is only available for customers that have updated to the [Foundation Services release](update-foundation-services-release.mdx).
:::

**Local User Account Management** gives **Zero Trust Secure Access** administrators the option to authorize user authentication into Internet Access and Private Access services without using a third-party identity provider. Administrators can enable or disable enrolled local user accounts at any time, allowing for controlled web access and connection to internal applications as necessary. Local users may also be assigned to one or more local user groups. As soon as a local user account or group is added, the individual account or group may be included as a target in a secure access rule.

The following table outlines the actions available in the **Local User Account Management** tab within **Identity and Access Management**.
