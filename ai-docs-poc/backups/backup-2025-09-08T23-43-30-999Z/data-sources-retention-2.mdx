View the status of Trend and third-party data sources that supply data to **Cyber Risk Exposure Management** and **Agentic SIEM & XDR**, including third-party log repositories, and manage data retention periods.

In the **Data sources and retention** section of **Data Source and Log Management**, you can view all available Trend and third-party data sources that contribute to threat and risk analyses for **Cyber Risk Exposure Management** and **Agentic SIEM & XDR**. The centralized location helps you see which data sources you have configured, what other data sources are available for configuration, and if any connection issues are preventing Trend Vision One from receiving data. Click a data source name to view details and learn how you can manage, connect, or disconnect the data source.

If you have configured third-party log repositories in [Third-Party Log Collection](third-party-log-intro.mdx), you can also view log repository configurations and details on associated collectors.

You can perform the following actions in the **Data sources and retention** section of **Data Source and Log Management**.

:::warning[Important]

To allow time for data to sync fully, you can only update the retention period for a data source once per day. Data retained for longer than the default 30-day or license-defined period requires additional credits. To learn more, see <a href="trend-vision-one-data-usage-monitoring">Data usage and monitoring</a>.
