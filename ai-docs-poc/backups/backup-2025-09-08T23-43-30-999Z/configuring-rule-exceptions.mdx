Add rule IDs to the Rule Exceptions list to exclude scan detections based on rule IDs.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  When configuring a parent policy, specify how other users can configure child policies.

    - **Inherit from parent**: Child policies must use the settings configured in the parent policy

    - **Extend from parent**: Child policies can append additional settings to the settings inherited from the parent policy

      :::note

      If your child policies **Extend from parent**, you can configure **Child Policy Restrictions** to prevent child policies from adding specified rules to the Rule Exceptions list.
