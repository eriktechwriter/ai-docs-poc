View and manage event rules for risk events marked as Dismissed or Accepted.

The **Event Rule Management** screen provides a centralized location to view and manage event rules. You may create event rules when changing the status of risk events and vulnerabilities. Statuses that support rule creation include:

- **Dismissed**: Marking a risk event as Dismissed and creating a related event rule prevents the reporting of future instances of the risk event, keeping them from affecting the Cyber Risk Index.

- **Accepted**: Marking a risk event as Accepted and creating a related event rule ensures existing and future instances of the risk event are marked as Accepted for the specified time period. Events marked as Accepted still contribute to your Cyber Risk Index.

Removing an event rule enables reporting for future instances of the related risk event.

The following table outlines the actions available on the **Event Rule Management** screen.
