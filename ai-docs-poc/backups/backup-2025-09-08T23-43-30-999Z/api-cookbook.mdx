Use the API Cookbook to perform specific tasks using cURL or PowerShell. Start with [Set Up to Use Bash or PowerShell](set-up-use-bash-or-powershell.mdx), and then you can move on to any other cookbook recipe:

- [Get a list of computers](get-list-computers-bash-powershell.mdx)
- [Search for a policy](search-for-policy-bash-powershell.mdx)
- [Assign a policy to a computer](policy-computer-bash-powershell.mdx)
- [Assign a policy to many computers](multi-policy-bash-powershell.mdx)
