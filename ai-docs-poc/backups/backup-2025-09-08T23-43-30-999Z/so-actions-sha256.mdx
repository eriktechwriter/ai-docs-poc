April 11, 2025—Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents now support "Log" and "Block" actions for File SHA-256 objects within the Suspicious Object List. This enhances threat response capabilities by allowing direct action on SHA-256 hashes identified as suspicious across Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

For more information, see [Suspicious Object Management](suspicious-object-management.mdx).
