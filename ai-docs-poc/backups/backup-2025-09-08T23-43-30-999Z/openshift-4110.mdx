Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file is owned by `root:root`.

The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, `/var/lib/kubelet/config.json` file is owned by `root:root`.

### Audit {#audit}

In OpenShift 4, the kubelet configuration file is managed by the Machine Config Operator and is found at `/var/lib/kubelet/config.json` or `/var/data/kubelet/config.json` with file permissions set to `root:root`.

For OpenShift 4.13 and above, run the following command to check the permission:

``` codeblock
for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
       oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %a
/var/data/kubelet/config.json
done
```

For earlier versions of OpenShift, run the following command to check the permission:

``` codeblock
for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
       oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %a
/var/lib/kubelet/config.json
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
