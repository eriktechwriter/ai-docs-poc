Ensure that the `scheduler.conf` file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.

The `scheduler.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, `scheduler.conf` has permissions of 640.
