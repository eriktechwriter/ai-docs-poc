Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kube-scheduler service in the master node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, `kube-scheduler.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
