February 23, 2024—In the Web Reputation filter, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection allows you to control whether to use the computer vision techniques for phishing detection. Computer vision clicks suspicious URLs in emails to access web pages and apply AI-based image analysis to detect threats. Previously, computer vision was enabled as long as you turned on Web Reputation.
