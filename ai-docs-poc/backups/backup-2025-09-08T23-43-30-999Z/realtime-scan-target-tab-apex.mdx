### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **User Activity on Files** section, select which file operations trigger scanning from the **Scan files being** drop-down.

    - **created/modified and retrieved**: Scans all files created, modified, or opened on the endpoint

    - **created/modified**: Scans all files created or modified on the endpoint

    - **retrieved**: Scans all files opened on the endpoint

2.  In the **Files to Scan** section, select from the following:

    - **All scannable files**: Includes all scannable files. Unscannable files are password protected files, encrypted files, or files that exceed the user-defined scanning restrictions.

      :::note

      This option provides the maximum security possible. However, scanning every file requires a lot of time and resources and might be redundant in some situations. Therefore, you might want to limit the amount of files the agent includes in the scan.
      :::

    - **File types scanned by IntelliScan**: Scans files based on true-file type.

    - **Files with the following extensions (use commas to separate entries)**: Manually specify the files to scan based on their extensions. Separate multiple entries with commas.

      :::note

      When configuring a parent policy, specify how other users can configure child policies.

      - **Inherit from parent**: Child policies must use the settings configured in the parent policy

      - **Extend from parent**: Child policies can append additional settings to the settings inherited from the parent policy
      :::

3.  In the **Scan Settings** section, configure the required settings.
