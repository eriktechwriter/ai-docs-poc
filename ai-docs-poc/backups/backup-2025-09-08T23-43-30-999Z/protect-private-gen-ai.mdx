August 1, 2024—Connected on-premises gateways in Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access and AI Service Access can now operate in reverse proxy mode. With Internet Access, use reverse proxy mode to protect your general private applications using access control, threat protection, and data loss protection (DLP). With AI Service Access, use reverse proxy mode to protect your private generative AI services using AI Service Access and rate limiting rules, enabling content inspection, preventing prompt injection, and stopping potential denial-of-service attacks. Enable the new service mode in **Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration**.
