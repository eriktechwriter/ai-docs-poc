A Service Gateway appliance can bridge your on-premises or third-party products through use of specialized services.

The Service Gateway provides connections to on-premises products, agents, and third-party applications deployed within your organization's network, providing visibility and allowing management of connected applications through Service Gateway Management. The **Service Gateway Management** screen (**Workflow and Automation â†’ Service Gateway Management**) provides an overview of connected Service Gateways.

:::note

The newly enhanced Service Gateway Management provides advanced service capabilities and better resource utilization. Migrate your existing Service Gateway 1.0 appliances now. The [Service Gateway Management (Legacy) tab](service-gateway-management-legacy.mdx) only appears to customers still managing older appliances.
