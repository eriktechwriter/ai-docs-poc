Implement compliance policies that determine what characterizes a compliant device in your environment.

A compliance policy consists of a set of highly customizable rules and settings that devices must meet to be considered compliant. You can create multiple compliance policies, each with different criteria, different actions, or different device group targets. The device is marked as “Noncompliant” if it fails to meet any settings of any applied compliance policies. You can perform actions based on their compliance status.

Compliance polices are supported on Android and iOS/iPadOS devices. Devices without a compliance policy are considered as **Noncompliant**.

The following table outlines the actions available on the **Mobile Compliance Policies** screen (**Mobile Security → Mobile Compliance Policies**).
