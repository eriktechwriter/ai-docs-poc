Configure network vulnerability scans to scan target network assets on a specified network segment with no agent deployment required.

:::warning[Important]

This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.
:::

To configure scans in Network Vulnerability Scanner, you need:

- A [deployed Service Gateway virtual appliance](deployment-guides.mdx) with the Network Vulnerability Scanner service version 1.1.0 or later installed

- IP addresses or FQDNs for the target network segment for vulnerability and discovery scans or target assets for external attack surface scans

- Authentication credentials for the target network assets for vulnerability scans

Available scan templates include:

- [Discovery scan](discover-scan.mdx):

  - Identifies live hosts, open ports, and basic system information within a network segment

  - Helps security teams map out their organizationâ€™s attack surface within the network and understand what assets are connected

  - Has a low impact on system resources

  - Does not require credentials

- [Vulnerability scan](vuln-scan.mdx):

  - Conducts a deep security assessment by logging into network devices using valid credentials

  - Identifies vulnerabilities that require authenticated access, such as missing patches, user permission issues, misconfigurations, and outdated applications

  - Requires credentials such as SSH authentication private keys or passwords

- [External attack surface scan](easm-scan.mdx):

  - Detects unexpected exposures and other vulnerabilities in internet-facing assets

  - Helps organizations understand their security posture from an external attacker's view

  - Focuses on public IPs, domains, and subdomains

  - Identifies misconfigurations, outdated software, and leaked services

Results from scans can be downloaded from **Scan reports** or viewed and managed in asset profile screens in **Attack Surface Discovery** or on risk event lists in **Threat and Exposure Management**.
