The **Top Malware Detected by Pattern-based Scanning** chart on the **Top Statistics** tab of **Dashboard** displays the email addresses that sent or received the most messages containing malware threats based on the selected mail traffic direction, as detected by traditional pattern-based scanning.

Hover over a bar to see details.

Select a time period by **Date**, **Week**, or **Month** to show data for the selected time period.

The specified time period only affects the data shown on this chart and its corresponding thumbnail chart on the **Threats** tab. Changing these selections does not affect other charts.

Use the **Top violators** drop-down list to select the number of email addresses that display on the chart.
