Detect vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets early in development with continuous visibility from code creation to cloud deployment.

:::warning[Important]

This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.
:::

Code Security enables efficient threat remediation and enhances security throughout the software development lifecycle by performing pre-runtime scans on artifacts. Enable Code Security to scan artifacts in your environment for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets.

Go to **Cloud Security â†’ Code Security** to get started.

1.  [Integrate Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) to your CI/CD pipeline](integrating-tmas-ci-cd-pipeline.mdx).
2.  [Analyze scan results in Artifacts inventory](artifacts-inventory-code-security.mdx).
3.  [Create policy rules](code-security-policies.mdx) for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets and [create scan overrides](override-vulnerability-findings.mdx) if needed.
