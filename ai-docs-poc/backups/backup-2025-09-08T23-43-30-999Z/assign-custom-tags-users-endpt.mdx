- Any Trend Micro Apex Central user account that has permission to create or modify custom tags, filters, or important labels in the **User/Endpoint Directory** can view or modify custom tags, filters, or important labels created by all other user accounts.

- Editing a tag, filter, or importance label on the **User/Endpoint Directory** screen also modifies the corresponding tag, filter, or importance label used by log queries and reports. For example, if the an endpoint is removed from a custom filter on the **User/Endpoint Directory** screen, then log queries and generated reports that use the filter will exclude data from the removed endpoint.
