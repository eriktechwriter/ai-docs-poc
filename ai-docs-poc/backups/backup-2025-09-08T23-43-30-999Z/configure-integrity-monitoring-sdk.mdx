Configure the Integrity Monitoring module to define its behavior for a policy. When designing the moduleâ€™s behavior and implementing it using the API, use the same background information and guidance that is provided in [About Integrity Monitoring](integrity-monitoring.mdx).

Policy objects contain two objects that you use to configure the Integrity Monitoring module:

- `IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension`: Controls the module state (real-time, on, or off) and identifies the Integrity Monitoring rules that are assigned to the module.
- `PolicySettings`: Policy settings include many Integrity Monitoring-related settings that control the runtime behavior of the module, such as the application of [recommendation scans](recommendation-scans-intro.mdx), whether real-time scan is enabled, performance-related settings, and the Syslog configuration to use. (See [Configure policy and default policy settings](create-configure-policy.mdx).)

After you create these objects and add them to a Policy object, you use the `PoliciesApi` class to modify an existing policy based on the `Policy` object.

The following JSON represents the data structure of an `IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension` object:

``` codeblock
{
    "state": "on",
    "moduleStatus": {...},
    "ruleIDs": [...]
}
```

The `moduleStatus` property is read-only. It provides the runtime status of the Integrity Monitoring module. (See [Report on Computer Status](report-computer-status.mdx).)

## General steps {#general-steps}

Use the following steps to configure the Integrity Monitoring module:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Create an `IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension` object and set the property values.

2.  Create a `PolicySettings` object to configure runtime settings of the module. (See [Configure policy and default policy settings](create-configure-policy.mdx).)

3.  Create a `Policy` object and add the `IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension` and `PolicySettings` objects.

4.  Use a `PoliciesApi` object to add or update the policy on Server & Workload Protection.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

Create an `IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension` object and set the module state:

``` codeblock
python policy_config_integrity_monitoring = api.IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension()
policy_config_integrity_monitoring.state = "on"
```

Set the rule IDs. Note that the Integrity Monitoring rules that are currently assigned to the policy will be overwritten:

``` codeblock
python policy_config_integrity_monitoring.rule_ids = im_rule_ids
```

At this point, the integrity Monitoring policy extension is configured. Next, it is added to a `Policy` object. Then use a `PoliciesApi` object to modify a policy on Server & Workload Protection.

``` codeblock
python policy = api.Policy()
policy.integrity_monitoring = policy_config_integrity_monitoring

policies_api = api.PoliciesApi(api.ApiClient(configuration))
modified_policy = policies_api.modify_policy(policy_id, policy, api_version)
```

The `policy_id` (or `policyID`) parameter of `modifyPolicy` identifies the actual policy on Server & Workload Protection that is to be modified. This policy is modified according to the policy object that is used as the `policy` parameter. Any properties of the `policy` parameter that are not set remain unchanged on the actual policy.

## Example {#example}

The following example turns on Integrity Monitoring and sets the rule IDs for an `IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension` object. The object is added to a `Policy` object which is used to update a policy on Server & Workload Protection.

[View source](https://github.com/deep-security/automation-center-sdk-samples/blob/master/python/src/integrity_monitoring_examples.py)

``` codeblock
# Turn on Integrity Monitoring
policy_config_integrity_monitoring = api.IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension()
policy_config_integrity_monitoring.state = "on"

# Add the rule IDs
policy_config_integrity_monitoring.rule_ids = im_rule_ids

# Add to a policy
policy = api.Policy()
policy.integrity_monitoring = policy_config_integrity_monitoring

# Modify the policy on Server & Workload Protection

policies_api = api.PoliciesApi(api.ApiClient(configuration))

modified_policy = policies_api.modify_policy(policy_id, policy, api_version)

return modified_policy.id
```

If you only need to add, remove, or list Integrity Monitoring rules for a policy, use the `PolicyIntegrityMonitoringRuleAssignmentsApi` class. The previous example uses the `IntegrityMonitoringPolicyExtension`, `Policy`, and `PoliciesApi` classes to set rules, but this can also be done using only the `PolicyIntegrityMonitoringRuleAssignmentsApi` class. For more information, see [Policy Integrity Monitoring Rule Assignments and Recommendations](https://automation.trendmicro.com/cloudone/workload-security/) in the Policies section of the API Reference.

## Create an Integrity Monitoring rule {#create-an-integrity-monitoring-rule}

Generally, to create a rule for the Integrity Monitoring module you perform the following steps:

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Create an IntegrityMonitoringRule object.

2.  Set the rule properties. Rules are described in [Create an Integrity Monitoring rule](create-integrity-monitoring-rule.mdx).

3.  Use an `IntegrityMonitoringRulesApi` object to add the rule to Server & Workload Protection.

### Next steps {#next-steps-1}

Set the `Template` property of the rule object to indicate how you are defining the rule:

- *File:* Set properties on the rule object to define how to monitor changes to files.
- *Registry:* Set properties on the rule object to define how to monitor changes to Windows registry values.
- *Custom:* Provide XML (base64-encoded) that defines how to monitor changes to directories, registry values, registry keys, services, processes, installed software, ports and files. The custom XML is used as the value of the `CustomXML` property of the rule object. The XML that you provide must be base64-encoded.

:::tip

Although Log Inspection rules have different properties than Integrity Monitoring rules, the way you create the rules are similar. You might find the [Create a basic Log Inspection rule](config-log-inspection-swp.mdx) and [Create a Log Inspection rule using XML](config-log-inspection-swp.mdx) examples helpful.
:::

:::note

Configuration options of Integrity Monitoring rules are not accessible using the API. To change these options, in the Server & Workload Protection console open the rule properties and click the Configuration tab.
:::

To use the API to create an Integrity Monitoring rule, send a POST request to the `integritymonitoringrules` endpoint. (See the [Create an Integrity Monitoring Rule](https://automation.trendmicro.com/cloudone/workload-security/) operation in the API Reference.)
