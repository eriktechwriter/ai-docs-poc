Find the UUID for a resource to assist with threat hunting when malware is detected by Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection.

Universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) are 128-bit-long numbers represented by 32 hexadecimal digits. UUIDs are used to uniquely identify partitions in a computer system. When malware is detected by Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection, you may use the UUID in the risk event metadata to search for more information, such as the location of the malware, in **XDR Data Explorer**. If no UUID is provided, you may still find the UUID using CLI commands.
