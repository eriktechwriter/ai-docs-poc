October 16, 2023—The Detection Model Management app has been updated to support multiple custom filters in a custom model, with a maximum limit of five custom filters per model. Users can configure the Workbench to trigger an alert based on two more criteria: when events defined by the custom filters occur, or when events defined by the custom filters occur in the specified order.

Fore more information, see [Configure a custom model](configuring-custom-model.mdx).
