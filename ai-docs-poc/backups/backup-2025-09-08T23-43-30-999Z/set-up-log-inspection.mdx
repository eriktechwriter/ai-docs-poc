For an overview of the log inspection module, see [About Log Inspection](log-inspection.mdx).

:::note

You need a Workload license to enable log inspection.
:::

To use log inspection, follow the steps in these procedures:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Turn on the log inspection module

2.  Run a recommendation scan

3.  Apply the recommended log inspection rules

4.  Test Log Inspection

5.  Configure log inspection event forwarding and storage

## Turn on the log inspection module {#turn-on-the-log-inspection-module}

Enable log inspection for a policy.

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Go to **Policies**.

2.  Double-click the policy.

3.  Select **Log Inspection → General**.

4.  Select **On** for *Log Inspection State*.

5.  Click **Save**.

## Run a recommendation scan {#run-a-recommendation-scan}

Run a [recommendation scan](recommendation-scans-intro.mdx) on the computer for recommendations about which rules to apply.

## Apply the recommended log inspection rules {#apply-the-recommended-log-inspection-rules}

Server & Workload Protection ships with many pre-defined rules covering a wide variety of operating systems and applications. When you run a [recommendation scan](recommendation-scans-intro.mdx), you can choose to have Server & Workload Protection [automatically implement recommendations](auto-imp-recommendations.mdx) or you can choose to [manually select and assign the rules](manual-assign-rules.mdx).

Although Server & Workload Protection ships with log inspection rules for many common operating systems and applications, you also have the option to create your own custom rules. To create a custom rule, you can either use the Basic Rule template, or you can write your new rule in XML. For information on how to create a custom rule, see [Define a log inspection rule for use in policies](define-inspection-rule.mdx).

## Test Log Inspection {#test-log-inspection}

Before completing Log Inspection configuration, test that the rules are working correctly:

### Procedure {#procedure-2}

1.  Ensure Log Inspection is enabled.

2.  In the computer or policies editor, select **Log Inspection → Advanced**.

3.  Set *Store events at the Agent/Appliance for later retrieval by DSM when they equal or exceed the following severity level* to **Low (3)** then click **Save**.

4.  On the *General* tab, click **Assign/Unassign**.

5.  Search for and enable *1002792 - Default Rules Configuration*. This is required for all other Log Inspection rules to work.

6.  Enable the rules for the platform:

    - For Windows, enable *1002795 - Microsoft Windows Events* to log events every time the Windows auditing functionality registers an event.
    - For Linux, enable *1002831 - Unix - Syslog* to inspect the syslog for events.

7.  Click **OK** then click **Save**.

8.  Try to log in to the server with an account that does not exist. Log Inspection should prevent this action.

9.  Go to **Events & Reports → Log Inspection Events** to verify the record of the failed log-in attempt. A record of the detection indicates Log Inspection is working correctly.

## Configure log inspection event forwarding and storage {#configure-log-inspection-event-forwarding-and-storage}

When an event triggers a log inspection rule, Server & Workload Protection logs the event. You can view these Log Inspection Events under **Events & Reports** and **Policy editor** (see [Log inspection events](log-inspection-events.mdx)). Depending on the severity of the event, you may send the event to a syslog server (see [Forward Server & Workload Protection events to an external syslog or SIEM server](forward-syslog-siem-server.mdx)) or store events in the database using the severity clipping feature.

To configure severity clipping:

### Procedure {#procedure-3}

1.  Go to *Policies* and double-click the policy.

2.  Select **Log Inspection → Advanced**.

3.  Choose a severity between **Low (0)** and **Critical (15)** for *Send Agent/Appliance events to syslog when they equal or exceed the following severity level*.

    This setting determines which events triggered by those rules get sent to the syslog server when syslog is enabled.

4.  Choose a severity between **Low (0)** and **Critical (15)** for *Store events at the Agent/Appliance for later retrieval by DSM when they equal or exceed the following severity level*.

    This setting determines which Log Inspection events the database keeps and appear on the *Log Inspection Events* page.

5.  Click **Save**.
