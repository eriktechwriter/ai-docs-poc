Synchronize your cloud projects into Trend Vision One for centralized project management.

The **Cloud overview** screen provides an overview of all your cloud projects.

To get started, you will see the **Define Projects** screen if you do not have any projects defined in Trend Vision One. You can start from the welcome screen or click the **Define Projects** drop-down to start defining a project.

**Define projects** drop-down allows you to create new projects with the following two options:

- **Map projects from cloud providers**: Synchronize tag values from your cloud provider into Trend Vision One to group your cloud assets into cloud projects.

- **Define projects based on conditions**: Create new projects by creating either new tag values or select existing tag values and define conditions and create automated tagging rules for your assets in a cloud project.

The following table outlines the actions available on the **Define Projects** screen:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 75%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><p>Action</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>

<p>For more information on how cloud mappings work, see: <a href="trend-vision-one-create-cloud-mapping">create a new cloud mapping</a>.</p>

By creating a new tag value, you are defining a new cloud project. The automated tagging rule created in the next step assigns the new tag value to assets, which associates those assets with your new cloud project.
