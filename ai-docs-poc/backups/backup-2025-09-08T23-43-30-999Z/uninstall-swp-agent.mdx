When you manually uninstall an activated agent from a computer, the computer doesn't notify Server & Workload Protection that the software has been uninstalled. On the Computers page in the Server & Workload Protection console, the computer's status will be "Managed (Offline)" or similar, depending on the context. To avoid this, in Server & Workload Protection, either:

- Deactivate the agent before you uninstall it, or
- Delete the computer from the list after you uninstall

## Uninstall an agent (Windows) {#uninstall-an-agent-windows}

:::note

Before updating or uninstalling an agent or relay on Windows, you must disable agent self-protection. To do this, in the Server & Workload Protection console, go to **Computer editor → Settings → General**. In *Agent Self Protection*, and then either deselect *Prevent local end-users from uninstalling, stopping, or otherwise modifying the Agent* or enter a password for local override.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Deactivate the agent using the Server & Workload Protection console by going to the *Computers* page, right-clicking the computer and selecting **Actions → Deactivate**.

    If you are unable to deactivate the agent because Server & Workload Protection is unable to communicate with the agent, you will need to do the following before continuing to the next step:

    `C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent>dsa_control --selfprotect 0`

2.  Go to the Control Panel and select *Uninstall a program*. Look for the Trend Micro Deep Security Agent and then select *Uninstall*.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

Alternatively, you can uninstall from the command line:

`msiexec /x <package name including extension>`

For a silent uninstall, add `/quiet`.

## Uninstall an agent (Linux) {#uninstall-an-agent-linux}

If your version of Linux provides a graphical package management tool, you can search for the `ds_agent` package and use the tool remove the package. Otherwise, use the command line instructions below.

# sudo rpm -ev ds_agent
Stopping ds_agent: [ OK ]
Unloading dsa_filter module [ OK ]

If iptables was enabled prior to installing agent, it will be re-enabled when the agent is uninstalled.
