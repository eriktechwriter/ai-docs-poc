Cloud Email Gateway Protection allows connection from the Directory Synchronization Tool to automate the import of directory files for valid recipient email addresses, user groups and email aliases. Also, Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides programmatic access through REST APIs, allowing customers to perform create, read, update and delete operations on resources within Cloud Email Gateway Protection.

To use these features, API Keys are required to authenticate the external systems' access to Cloud Email Gateway Protection.

The **API Access** tab lets you obtain and manage your API Keys.
