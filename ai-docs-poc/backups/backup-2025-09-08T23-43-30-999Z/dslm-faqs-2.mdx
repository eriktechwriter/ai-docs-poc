## How do I upload a certificate to a Service Gateway? {#how-do-i-upload-a-certificate-to-a-service-gateway}

Your third-party data sources may require your Service Gateway to have a certificate for validation purposes. To receive data from the data source, you must upload a valid certificate. In order to perform the following steps, you need a CA certificate for your organization that meets the following requirements:

- Satisfies PKCS \#1 standards

- Contains both `RSA PRIVATE KEY` and `CERTIFICATE`

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Ensure the private key is not encrypted.

    1.  Run the following script to decrypt and regenerate your certificate PEM file.

        ``` codeblock
        #!/bin/bash

        # Check if exactly 2 parameters are provided
        if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
            echo "Warning: You must provide exactly 2 parameters."
            echo "Usage: $0 <<original>>.pem <<decrypted>>.pem"
            exit 1
        fi

        # Parameters
        INPUT_PEM=$1
        OUTPUT_PEM=$2

        TEMP_CERT="temp_cert.pem"
        TEMP_KEY="temp_key_encrypted.pem"
        TEMP_KEY_DEC="temp_key_decrypted.pem"

        # extract cert
        openssl x509 -in "$INPUT_PEM" -out "$TEMP_CERT"

        # extract key
        openssl pkey -in "$INPUT_PEM" -out "$TEMP_KEY"

        # decrypt key
        openssl rsa -in "$TEMP_KEY" -out "$TEMP_KEY_DEC"

        # combine cert and decrypt key into new PEM
        cat "$TEMP_CERT" "$TEMP_KEY_DEC" > "$OUTPUT_PEM"
        # clear temp
        rm "$TEMP_CERT" "$TEMP_KEY" "$TEMP_KEY_DEC"

        echo "New pem generated.New filename = "$OUTPUT_PEM"
        ```

2.  Confirm the output format is as follows:

    ``` codeblock
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    (base64....)
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
    (base64....)
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    ```

3.  In **Service Gateway Management**, click the **Configure settings** icon (![](/images/configure=GUID-657DB993-ADC7-4DEC-8C62-C8739D74760E.webp)) next to the Service Gateway to which you wish to upload the certificate.

    The **Service Gateway Settings** window appears.

4.  Click **Import certificate**.

5.  Click **Select fileâ€¦** and select your certificate file.

6.  Click **Import**.

7.  Click **Save**.

    The certificate is uploaded to the virtual appliance.
