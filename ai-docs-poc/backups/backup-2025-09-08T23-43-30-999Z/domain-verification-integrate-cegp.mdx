March 19, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection now integrates with the domain verification feature in Trend Vision One. Domains added in Cloud Email Gateway Protection will automatically appear in the **Domain Verification** screen under **Administration**. This integration also allows administrators to verify domains in either Cloud Email Gateway Protection or **Domain Verification**, with the verification results applying to both locations.
