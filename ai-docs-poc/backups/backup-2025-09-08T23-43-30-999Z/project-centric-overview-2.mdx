Get an overview of your cloud projects in Cloud Security Posture using interactive widgets and table views.

**All cloud projects** allows you to [Define and Manage Projects](define-manage-projects.mdx) and also gives you visibility into the cloud projects your organization uses for a wide variety of applications, including risk events, misconfigurations, and potential attack paths.

The **Cloud Overview** tab in **Cloud Security Posture** displays widgets summarizing key information about the cloud projects in your connected cloud accounts. The summary overview displays a breakdown of your projects in the following categories:

- Risk events

- Protection

- Security Posture

- Potential Attack Paths

- Assets at Risk
