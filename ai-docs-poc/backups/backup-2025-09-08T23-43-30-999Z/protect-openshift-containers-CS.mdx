Red Hat OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that provides basic security features including security hardening and FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) compliant encryption (FIPS 140-2 Level 1).

Add Container Security to your OpenShift environment to deploy comprehensive protection for OpenShift containers and worker nodes as well as pod and node level visibility and controls.

:::note

Container Security supports OpenShift versions 4.12 and later. [Learn more](openshift-requirements.mdx).

### Container Security protection for OpenShift {#container-security-protection-for-openshift}

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization allows you to run and deploy virtual machine (VM) workloads alongside containerized applications in OpenShift. This creates a hybrid environment where both containerized applications and traditional VM workloads coexist.

Container Security can protect containerized applications running on container-optimized operating systems commonly used in OpenShift, like CoreOS, with minimal host/OS dependencies.

Container Security can also protect the following in OpenShift containerized applications:

- Container images

- Container runtime

- Worker nodes

:::note

OpenShift control plane, host/master nodeâ€™s OS, and VM workloads are not included in Container Security OpenShift protection.
:::

For complete protection of OpenShift environments, you might need to combine Container Security with Server & Workload Protection (SWP) based on your OpenShift requirements. Learn more about [protecting OpenShift containers in SWP](protect-openshift-containers.mdx).

For more information about the recommended exclusions for OpenShift namespaces and how to add runtime security to the infrastructure and master nodes, see [OpenShift requirements](openshift-requirements.mdx).
