January 29, 2024—In addition to Microsoft Intune-managed devices the Zero Trust Secure Access mobile module can now be deployed to all managed or unmanaged mobile devices, allowing you to secure more mobile endpoints. If you do not currently have an MDM solution, the mobile module supports deployment through Mobile Device Director. For more information, see [Deploying the Secure Access Module to Mobile Devices](deploying-sam-mobile-devices.mdx).
