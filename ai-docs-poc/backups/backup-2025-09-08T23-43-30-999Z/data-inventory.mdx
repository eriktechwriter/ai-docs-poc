Manage, locate, and take action on assets with sensitive data with Data Inventory. Assets with sensitive data are defined by the data policies created for your organization. The Data Inventory list updates automatically when data policies are created or updated, and when assets are added or removed to the network locations specified in the data policies.

:::note

You must enable the *Endpoint sensor detection and response* setting in **Endpoint Security** to send activity data for state-of-the-art threat detections and alerts (required for advanced XDR detections and Workbench alerts). This setting requires credits to enable. For more information, see [Configure endpoint security policies](configuring-endpoint-policies.mdx).
