Set up rules for user web activity traffic using upstream proxies on your Internet Access On-Premises Gateway.

### Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

:::warning[Important]

- To use the proxy settings of your Service Gateway for user web activity traffic, you must configure a proxy server for your Service Gateway virtual appliance via [Service Gateway CLI commands](service-gateway-cli-commands.mdx).

- Ensure you have upgraded the Internet Access On-Premises Gateway service to the latest version. If enabled on an outdated on-premises gateway, only upstream proxy rules allowing direct traffic to destinations can function. All other traffic is sent directly to your Service Gateway virtual appliance.
:::

Configuring upstream proxy rules for your Internet Access On-Premises Gateway allows you to send user web activity traffic to specified domains, subdomains, and IP addresses via proxy.

:::note

Upstream proxy rules only apply to user-initiated web activity traffic on the on-premises gateway. Traffic initiated directly by the on-premises gateway for administrative purposes, including traffic to Trend Vision One, Smart Protection Network, and ActiveUpdate services, automatically uses the proxy settings configured in the current Service Gateway.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **Advanced Settings** tab of your on-premises gateway settings, enable upstream proxy for data traffic.

2.  Select **Add Upstream Proxy Rule**.

3.  In the window that appears, add the desired domains, subdomains, or IP addresses in the **Destinations** field.

    :::note

    - Zero Trust Secure Access supports the following wildcard characters:

      - \*: Matches any number of characters

      - ?: Matches a single character in a specific position

    - You may add a maximum of 100 destinations.
    :::

4.  Select the desired proxy option.

    - **Allow direct traffic**: Permits traffic directly to the added destinations
    - **Use proxy settings in Service Gateway**: Sends traffic through the proxy configured in the Service Gateway virtual appliance currently running the Internet Access On-Premises Gateway service
    - **Specify on-premises proxy**: Sends traffic through a third-party proxy determined by the FQDN or IP address and port number you provide

      :::note

      The on-premises proxy option does not support proxy authentication.
      :::

5.  Click **Add** to add the rule to the upstream proxy rules list.

    :::warning[Important]

    - You may only add one upstream proxy rule at time allowing direct traffic or using the proxy settings of the current Service Gateway, but you may specify multiple on-premises proxies.

    - You may add a maximum of 10 rules.
    :::

6.  Drag individual rules to set priority.

7.  Click **Save** to save the on-premises gateway settings.
