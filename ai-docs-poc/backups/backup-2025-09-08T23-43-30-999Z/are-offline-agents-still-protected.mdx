Agents showing as "Offline" in the Server & Workload Protection console are still being protected according to their last known configuration. However, they will not receive any software, security or policy updates until communication with Server & Workload Protection is restored.

For more information on how to bring an agent out of "Offline" status, see ["Offline" agent](offline-agent.mdx).
