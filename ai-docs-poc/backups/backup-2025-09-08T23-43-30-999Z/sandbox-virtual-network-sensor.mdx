June 3, 2024—The Virtual Network Sensor now supports automatically submitting file objects to a virtual sandbox for analysis as a pre-release feature.

The "send to sandbox" feature can be enabled from the Network Inventory screen, with the analysis report available to view in the Sandbox Analysis app. File objects submitted by the Virtual Network Sensor to the sandbox using this feature do not require credits to use during the pre-release period.
