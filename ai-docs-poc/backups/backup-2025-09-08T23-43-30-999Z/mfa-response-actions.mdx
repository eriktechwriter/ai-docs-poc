April 8, 2024—In order to increase the security of critical action use, you can now enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a requirement to run certain response actions, including Collect File, Run Remote Custom Script, Start Remote Shell Session, and Submit for Sandbox Analysis, as well as to add a new custom script in Response Management. You can configure MFA settings in the User Accounts app.

For more information, see [Enable and configure multi-factor authentication](enable-confige-mfa.mdx).
