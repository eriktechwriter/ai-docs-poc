May 20, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection extends its Bypass Checks for approved senders in Sender Filter Settings. In addition to the existing Connection Filtering and Spam Filtering criteria, this enhancement allows administrators to determine whether to apply security risks and anomalies scanning on emails from approved senders. This provides a more comprehensive and robust security framework, ensuring that even approved senders are subject to advanced threat detection and mitigation.
