If you use ServiceNow in your business workflow, you can manually create tickets or configure triggers for automatic ticket creation for any relevant events in your account.

### Set up a ServiceNow channel {#set-up-a-servicenow-channel}

1.  Click on *Create a ServiceNow channel*.

2.  [Set automatic notifications](toggle-automatic-notifications.mdx)

3.  [Set manual notifications](toggle-manual-notifications.mdx)

4.  Input *Channel Name* to distinguish the channel from others of the same type

    :::note

    The field is limited to 20 characters
    :::

5.  [Configure Triggers](communication-triggers.mdx)

6.  *Configure board now* requires a three-step process

    1.  Integrate with ServiceNow by entering the following details
        1.  *ServiceNow URL*
        2.  *Username*
        3.  *Password*

    On successful integration, the Cloud Risk Management dashboard will automatically load the meta-data from your ServiceNow account.

    1.  Enter *Extra settings* to customize your communication channel. You can set a notification to be reported as either a Problem, Incident or a Configuration Test Result.
    2.  Configure *Advanced settings* for example, Creation override and Resolution override.

        :::note

        To send notifications to multiple users, you can assign a ServiceNow ticket to a group directly.
        :::
    3.  *Test settings* to ensure correct configurations have been set up

        :::note

        The *itil* role does not need delete permissions, however, if you choose not to provide the delete permissions, the test record created by Cloud Risk Management will still exist after the connection is tested.
        :::
    4.  [Copy communication settings](copy-communication-settings.mdx)

*Custom Field Examples*

You can include most custom fields in the override fields under *Advanced settings.*

For example:

*Creation override*

``` codeblock
{
    "impact": 1,
    "urgency": 1,
    "priority": 1
}
```

*Resolution override*

``` codeblock
{
    "close_notes": "Problem/Incident has been marked as resolved by Cloud Risk Management."
}
```

*JSON example for override field of Service Now (SNOW) integration.*

*Creation Override:*

``` codeblock
{
    "impact": 1,
    "urgency": 1,
    "priority": 1
}
```

*Resolution Override:*

``` codeblock
{
    "close_notes": "Problem/Incident has been marked as resolved by Cloud Risk Management."
    }
```

This will work with SNOW API [here](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do).

Example of JSON from Cloud Risk Management

Cloud Risk Management posts to Table API v1 (`/api/now/v1/table/problem` or `/api/now/v1/tableincident`).

Request body looks like this:

``` codeblock
{

    "short_description": "",
    
    "description": "",
    
    "comments": "",
    
    "urgency": "",
    
    "impact": "",
    
    "priority": "",
    
    "assigned_to": "" 
    
    "caller": ""<== Only for incidents,
    
    }
```

Depending on the version and configuration of your ServiceNow instance, extra fields may be available. You can refer to REST API Explorer from within ServiceNow to see which fields are available to include on request override.

### Filtering Incidents/Problems {#filtering-incidentsproblems}

### Option 1: Using a Source field {#option-1-using-a-source-field}

1.  In *ServiceNow*, add a custom field to the *Incident/Problem* table.
    1.  Keep a note of the Column name being generated. For example, when the custom field 'Source' was created it generated a column name 'u_source'.
    2.  For more information about adding custom fields to a ServiceNow table, see: [Adding Fields to a Table](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do).
2.  In Cloud Risk Management, add a Creation override JSON payload for the Cloud Risk Management account’s ServiceNow communications channel settings.
    1.  Configure the ServiceNow channel by going to **Main Dashboard → Select {Account} → Settings → Communication settings → Update communication settings → Configure 'ServiceNow'**.
    2.  Click *Configure board*.
    3.  Under *Advanced Settings*, add the JSON payload with the custom field as key (e.g. `u_source`) and the value as `Trend Micro`. E.g. `{"u_source": "Trend Micro"}`.
    4.  Enter the password again and press the *Connect* button to enable the *Save* button.
3.  The custom Source field can now be used for filtering.

### Option 2: Using a custom field {#option-2-using-a-custom-field}

You can use a custom field to filer the description information ending with the keywords `source: Trend Micro` for an Incident/Problem generated by Cloud Risk Management.

1.  In *ServiceNow*, go to *All Incidents/Problems* \> click on the *filter* icon.
2.  Select *Description* from the first dropdown, *ends with* from the second and enter *Trend Micro*.
3.  Click *Run* to display the Incidents/Problems generated by Cloud Risk Management with a description ending with "Trend Micro".
