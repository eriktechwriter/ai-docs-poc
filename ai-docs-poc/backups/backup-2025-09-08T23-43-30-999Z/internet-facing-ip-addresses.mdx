Attack Surface Discovery discovers and assesses your internet-facing IP addresses as part of your external attack surface.

Attack Surface Discovery discovers your internet-facing IP addresses by checking A records for your domains, the pointer (PTR) records for the related IPs, and information from your domains' SSL certificates. You may also add IP addresses manually. Manually added IP addresses undergo a secondary verification process before appearing in **Internet-Facing Assets**. Data for internet-facing IP addresses is updated daily.

IP-related risks are identified based on the following factors:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 75%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><p>Factor</p></th>
<th><p>Example of risk</p></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Service</p></td>
<td><p>Unexpected service observed on the public network</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Port</p></td>
<td><p>Unexpected port observed</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>CVE</p></td>
<td><p>Application vulnerability identified on internet-facing assets</p></td>

The following table outlines the actions you can perform on the **Public IPs** tab:
