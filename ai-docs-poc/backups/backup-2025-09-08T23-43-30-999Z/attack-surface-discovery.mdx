Discover your organizational assets that might be exposed to attack, including devices, internet-facing assets, accounts, applications, and cloud assets.

**Attack Surface Discovery** allows you to locate corporate assets that threat actors might be able to use to attack your organization. Each section of the **Attack Surface Discovery** app provides insights into an asset type within your organization.

:::warning[Important]

You must allocate credits to Cyber Risk Exposure Management to fully access **Attack Surface Discovery**. Customers with XDR sensor entitlements that have not allocated credits to Cyber Risk Exposure Management have limited access to the [asset profile screens](asset-profile-screens.mdx) related to their XDR sensors. For more information, see [Credit requirements for Trend Vision One solutions, capabilities, and features](credit-req-for-apps-services.mdx).
:::

:::note

The data available for a user to view and drill down depends on the asset visibility scope of the current user. For more information about the asset visibility scope, see [Asset Visibility Management](asset-visibility-management.mdx).
