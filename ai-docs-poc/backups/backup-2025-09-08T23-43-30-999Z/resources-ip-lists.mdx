Configure lists of IP addresses to monitor or exclude from monitoring.

:::warning[Important]

If you are working on a policy, make sure to save your settings before leaving the screen. Leaving the screen without saving discards any changes.
:::

IP lists are a policy resource where you can define a list of IP addresses for the following features:

- [Intrusion Prevention](policies-intrusion-prevention.mdx): Define trusted IP addresses, such as internal service hosts, to exclude from Intrusion Prevention monitoring and scans.

- [Firewall rules](resources-firewall-rules.mdx): Define specific source or destination IP addresses you want your Firewall rules to monitor.

You can add up to 250 IP lists.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Policy Resources → IP Lists**.

2.  Create or edit a list.

    - To create a new list, click **Add IP list**.

    - To edit an existing list, click the list name and go to **General**

3.  Specify a name and description for the list.

4.  Specify an IP address or address range.

    You can specify IP addresses and ranges in IPv4 or IPv6 format.

    :::warning[Important]

    Firewall rules using ICMP or ICMPv6 protocol have strict support for IP address formats. Using an IP list that contains both IPv4 and IPv6 might cause unintended behavior.

    - If you want to use the ICMP protocol, only include IP addresses with the IPv4 format. The ICMP protocol ignores IPv6 addresses.

    - If you want to use the ICMPv6 protocol, only include IP addresses with the IPv6 format. The ICMPv6 protocol ignores IPv4 addresses.

5.  To add more IP addresses, click **Add**.

    You can specify up to 15 items per list.

6.  Click **Save**.
