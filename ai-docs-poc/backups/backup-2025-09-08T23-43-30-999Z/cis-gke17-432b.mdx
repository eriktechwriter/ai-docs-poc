Use network policies to isolate traffic in the cluster network.

Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace.

:::note

By default, network policies are not created.

### Impact {#impact}

Once network policies are in use within a given namespace, traffic not explicitly allowed by a network policy will be denied. As such it is important to ensure that, when introducing network policies, legitimate traffic is not blocked.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the below command and review the `NetworkPolicy` objects created in the cluster.

``` codeblock
kubectl get networkpolicy --all-namespaces 

ensure that each namespace defined in the cluster has at least one Network Policy.
```

### Remediation {#remediation}

Follow the documentation and create `NetworkPolicy` objects as needed.

See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/network-policy) for more information.
