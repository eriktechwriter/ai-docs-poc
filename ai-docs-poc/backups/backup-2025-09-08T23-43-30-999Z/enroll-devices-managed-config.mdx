**Mobile Security** allows you to enroll devices managed by any MDM solution that supports managed configuration.

Users that already have an MDM solution or do not wish to integrate a supported MDM solution directly with **Mobile Security** can still protect their devices by setting up managed configuration in the MDM solution. **Mobile Security** works with any MDM solution that supports managed configuration, including:

- [Ivanti (MobileIron)](managed-config-ivanti-mobileiron.mdx)

- ManageEngine

- IBM MaaS360

Once integrated with the MDM solution, **Mobile Security** secures enrolled iOS and Android devices using the **Mobile Security for Business** app. Setting up managed configuration allows you to automatically deploy the app directly to managed devices. Devices with the **Mobile Security for Business** app may also use the security features of Zero Trust Secure Access once the necessary settings are configured.

:::warning[Important]

If you manage both iOS and Android devices with your MDM solution, you must configure settings for both types of device in order to enroll all devices in **Mobile Security**.
