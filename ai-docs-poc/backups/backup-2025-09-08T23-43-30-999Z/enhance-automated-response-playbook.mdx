You can now specify detection models when configuring trigger settings for Automated Response playbooks. The subsequent nodes in the playbook are only triggered for Workbench alerts related to the specified detection models.

Playbooks also adds support for additional webhook types in user-defined Automated Response playbooks.

For more information, see [Create Automated Response Playbooks](create-automated-response-playbooks.mdx).
