:::warning[Important]

For accurate analysis, configure your [Network Resource Lists](network-resource-lists.mdx) in **Network Security → Network Analysis Configuration → Network Resources**. Configuring Network Resource Lists provides the Network Analytics engine with context about the topography of your security environment. You can configure multiple [Network Resource profiles](configuring-resource-profile.mdx) for more granular detail, especially if you monitor multiple networks or company branches from your Trend Vision One console.

The network analytics report is available for all apps that use Network Sensors as a data source, including Virtual Network Sensor, TippingPoint, and Deep Discovery Inspector.

The network analytics report shows network correlations between the trigger object selected in **Observable Graph** and other related objects. The network analytics report consists of three main sections: Summary, Correlation Graph, and Transactions and IoCs.

The **Summary** includes the following information:

- Severity

- Number of detected internal hosts and indicators of compromise (IOCs)

- Attack patterns

- High-level overview of the malicious activity of the correlated event

You can show or hide the summary section using the show/hide icons (![](/images/dddna_summary_collapse=GUID-30E62BCB-0E12-4C53-967D-71834FAF56FD=1=en-us=Low.webp) or ![](/images/dddna_summary_expand=GUID-CA101720-956C-4123-A237-5A030D727B17=1=en-us=Low.webp)).

For more details about the information provided in summary and the actions you can take, see [Review the summary](reviewing-summary.mdx).

The **Correlation Graph** provides a visual representation of correlations made between the selected suspicious object and other related objects.

Click ![](/images/dddna_graph_filter=GUID-1A803C70-BBB6-4F2B-BF16-6B5CFFFAC409=1=en-us=Low.webp) next to the *Playback Bar* to display or hide the advanced search filter.

For more details about the information displayed in the correlation graph and the actions you can take, see [Analysis using the Correlation Graph](analysis-using-correlation-graph.mdx).

<figcaption>Network analytics transactions and IOCs</figcaption>
</figure>

The **Transactions and IOCs** section provides details about each transaction represented in the correlation graph and each detected Indicator of Compromise (IOC).

The report lists transactions from oldest to most recent. Listed transactions might have occurred in a single day or span several months, depending on the correlations found by Network Analytics. The report lists IOCs from oldest to most recent.

You can show or hide the transactions and IOCs section using the show/hide icons (![](/images/dddna_trans_iocs_collapse=GUID-90155883-8966-4D26-B6AC-D0918BEC3089=1=en-us=Low.webp) or ![](/images/dddna_trans_iocs_expand=GUID-ACD57F7E-4D64-4EAF-B624-D22B51459C24=1=en-us=Low.webp)).

For more details about the information displayed in the transactions and IOCs section, see [Analysis using Transactions and IOCs](analysis-transaction-ioc-details.mdx).
