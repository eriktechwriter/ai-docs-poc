Schedules are reusable timetables that you can assign to rules, agent upgrades, and more.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Server & Workload Protection console, go to **Policies → Common Objects → Other → Schedules**.

2.  Click **New → New Schedule**.

3.  In the *General Information* area, enter a name and description used to identify the schedule.

4.  Click a time block in the grid to select it. To deselect it, click it while pressing Shift. Schedule periods are defined by hour-long time blocks.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

After you assign the schedule to a rule, it is displayed on the Assigned To tab for the schedule. To link a security rule to a schedule, go to the *Options* tab in the security rule's *Properties* window and select the schedule from the "Schedule" list.

:::note

Schedules use the same time zone as the protected computer's operating system.
