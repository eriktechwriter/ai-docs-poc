For your Android and iOS devices, you must provide the certificate in PEM format (plain text, Base64 encoded) for the two options:

- The company Certificate Authority (CA) certificate that is present in the Trust Store.

- The client certificate that is signed by company's CA

The content should look like this:

``` codeblock
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Base64-encoded certificate content here)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Format Requirements:

- Plain text format (can be opened in a text editor)

- Must start with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and end with `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`

- The content between must be Base64 encoded

- The certificate must include the public key

- Do not remove or alter any line breaks

Do not provide:

- Binary formats such as `.der` or binary `.cer` files

- Files that contain unreadable characters or cannot be opened as plain text

:::note

If your current certificate is binary, you can convert it to PEM using the following commands

- For a macOS or linux environment:

  ``` codeblock
  openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem
  ```

- For a Windows environment(PowerShell, Windows 7 or later):

  ``` codeblock
  certutil -encode "C:\certificate.cer" "C:\certificate.pem"
  ```
