Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface.

:::note

By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0.
:::

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
```

Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1

### Remediation {#remediation}

Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter.

:::note

Although the current Kubernetes documentation site says that `--address` is deprecated in favour of `--bind-address` Kubeadm 1.11 still makes use of `--address`.
