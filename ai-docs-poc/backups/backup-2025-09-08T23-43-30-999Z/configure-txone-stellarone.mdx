Find out how to connect and configure your TXOne StellarOne services to start sharing data with Trend Vision One.

This feature requires Trend Vision One credits for continued usage.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  If you do not have an existing Service Gateway deployed, deploy a Service Gateway virtual appliance and register the Service Gateway to Trend Vision One.

    1.  Install or launch a Service Gateway virtual appliance on a supported platform.

        :::note

        Connecting TXOne StellarOne requires the forward proxy service on the Service Gateway. For detailed Service Gateway system requirements based on service deployment, see [Service Gateway appliance system requirements](sg-sys-requirements.mdx).
        :::

    2.  Use the CLI to configure the IPv4 address, endpoint name, NTP server, and DNS settings for the Service Gateway.

        For more information about available commands, see [Service Gateway CLI commands](service-gateway-cli-commands.mdx).

    3.  Register the Service Gateway to Trend Vision One.

    4.  Confirm the connection status in the Trend Vision One console in Service Gateway Management.

        **Healthy** appears in the **Connection status** column if connection to Trend Vision One succeeds.

    For detailed deployment instructions, see [Deployment guides](deployment-guides.mdx).

    :::note

    You can also use an existing Service Gateway virtual appliance if it meets the system requirements and is configured with required settings for connection with TXOne StellarOne.
    :::

2.  Configure the **Forward proxy** service on the Service Gateway virtual appliance.

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management**.

    2.  On the **Service Gateway Management** screen, click the Service Gateway name.

    3.  Click **Manage Services**.

    4.  In the **Manage Services** panel, click the install icon (![](/images/SG2_install_icon=GUID-feef28dd-2ddb-4093-b4e4-5455a0b110bb.webp)) to install the **Forward proxy** service.

    5.  Configure your firewall exceptions for connection with Trend Vision One.

3.  Obtain the API key that you need to use to authenticate connections with TXOne StellarOne through the forward proxy service.

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management**.

    2.  On the **Service Gateway Management** screen, click **Manage API Key**, and record the API key in the **API Key** panel that appears.

4.  Obtain the enrollment token that you need to use in the StellarOne console to identify your Trend Vision One console.

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Service Management → Product Instance**.

    2.  Click **Add Existing Product**.

    3.  On the **Product Connection** panel, select **TXOne StellarOne** from the **Instance type** drop-down list.

    5.  Record the enrollment token.

    6.  Click **Save**.

        **Pending** appears in the **Status** column, which means that Trend Vision One is ready for connection with TXOne StellarOne.

        The enrollment token expires if not used within 24 hours of generation. To regenerate a valid enrollment token, click **Regenerate** in the **Status** column.

5.  Configure service integration settings to integrate your TXOne StellarOne environment with Trend Vision One and send data to Trend Vision One.

    1.  Sign in to your TXOne StellarOne console.

    2.  Go to **Administration → Service Integration**.

    3.  Specify the **Service Gateway Address**, **Service Gateway API Key**, and **Enrollment Token** based on the information obtained in the previous steps.

    4.  Click **Test Connection**.

        A message "Test Connection successful" appears if connection to Trend Vision One succeeds.

    5.  Turn on the **Send StellarOne malware detection logs to Vision One** toggle and select the interval at which TXOne StellarOne sends logs to Trend Vision One.

    6.  Click **Save**.

6.  Go to the Trend Vision One console and confirm the connection status in Product Instance.

    **Connected** appears in the **Status** column if your TXOne StellarOne environment connects properly with Trend Vision One.
