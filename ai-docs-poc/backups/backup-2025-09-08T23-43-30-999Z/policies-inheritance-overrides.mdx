Policies in Server & Workload Protection are intended to be created in a hierarchical structure. As an administrator, you begin with one or more base policies from which you create multiple levels of child policies that get progressively more granular in their detail. You can assign broadly applicable rules and other configuration settings at the top-level policies and then get more targeted and specific as you go down through levels of child policies, eventually arriving at rule and configuration assignments at the individual computer level.

As well as assigning more granular settings as you move down through the policy tree, you can also override settings from higher up the policy tree.

Server & Workload Protection provides a collection of policies that you can use as initial templates for the design of your own policies tailored to your environment:

### Inheritance {#inheritance}

Child policies inherit their settings from their parent policies. This allows you to create a policy tree that begins with a base parent policy configured with settings and rules that will apply to all computers. This parent policy can then have a set of child and further descendant policies which have progressively more specific targeted settings. Your policy trees can be built based on any kind of classification system that suits your environment. For example, the branches in the policy tree that comes with Server & Workload Protection has branches designed for specific operating systems. The Windows branch has further child policies for various sub-types of Windows operating systems.

In the *Windows* policy editor on the *Overview* page, you can see that the *Windows* policy was created as a child of the *Base Policy*. The policy's anti-malware setting is *Inherited (Off)*:

This means that the setting is inherited from the parent *Base Policy*, and that if you were to change the anti-malware setting in the *Base Policy* from *Off* to *On*, the setting would change in the *Windows* policy as well. (The *Windows* policy setting would then read *Inherited (On)*. The value in parentheses always shows you what the current inherited setting is.)

### Overrides {#overrides}

The *Overrides* page shows you how many settings have been overridden at this policy or specific computer level. To undo the overrides at this level, click the *Remove* button.

In this example, the *Windows Server* policy is a child policy of the *Windows* policy. Here, the anti-malware setting is no longer inherited; it is overridden and hard-set to *On*.

You can automate override checking, creation, and removal using the Server & Workload Protection API. For examples, see [Configure Computers to Override Policies](override-policies-computer.mdx).

### Override object properties {#override-object-properties}

The intrusion prevention rules that are included in this policy are copies of the intrusion prevention rules stored by Server & Workload Protection, which are available for use by any other policies. If you want to change the properties of a particular rule, you have two choices: modify the properties of the rule globally so that the changes you make apply to all instances where the rule is in use, or modify the properties locally so that the changes you make only apply locally. The default editing mode in a Computer or policy editor is *local*. If you click *Properties* on the *Assigned Intrusion Prevention Rules* area toolbar, any changes you make in the Properties window that appears will only apply locally. (Some properties like the rule name can't be edited locally, only globally.)

Right-clicking a rule displays a context menu which gives you the two Properties editing mode options: selecting *Properties* will open the local editor window and *Properties (Global)* will open the global editor window.

Most of the shared common objects in Server & Workload Protection can have their properties overridden at any level in the policy hierarchy right down to the individual computer level.

### Override rule assignments {#override-rule-assignments}

You can always assign additional rules at any policy or computer level. However, rules that are in effect at a particular policy or computer level because their assignment is inherited from a parent policy cannot be unassigned locally. They must be unassigned at the policy level where they were initially assigned.

:::tip

If you find yourself overriding a large number of settings, you should probably consider branching your parent policy.

### View the overrides on a computer or policy at a glance {#view-the-overrides-on-a-computer-or-policy-at-a-glance}

You can see the number of settings that have been overridden on a policy or a computer by going to the *Overrides* page in the Computer or Policy Editor:

![](/images/policy-windows-server-overrides=57bea30c-5979-430e-bf73-367a347bf276.webp)

Overrides are displayed by protection module. You can revert system or module overrides by clicking the *Remove* button.
