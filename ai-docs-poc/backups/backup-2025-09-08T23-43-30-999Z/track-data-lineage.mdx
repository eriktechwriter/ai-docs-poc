Data Lineage offers a visualization of how sensitive data has been transmitted between endpoints within your organization, and identifies potential data leakage points. You can investigate a Data Lineage graph to:

- determine the origin point of sensitive data

- view how sensitive data has been transmitted from one endpoint to another

- view detailed information about a specific file, including file type, file size, and the file's URI. If the file is a zip file, you can expand to see the compressed files.

The following table describes the elements that comprise Data Lineage.
