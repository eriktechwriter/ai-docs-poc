After scanned by Inline Protection of Trend Micro Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, emails are delivered to Microsoft's mail server for your Exchange Online service, where they go through some security checking. Since the sending IP addresses and hostnames of the emails change to those of Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, the emails may fail Microsoft's security checks. To prevent such failure, make sure you perform the following verification before granting access to Exchange Online (Inline Mode).

:::note

During the access grant, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will also automatically update the allow entries for spoofed senders in the Tenant Allow/Block List and IP Allow List in connection filtering in your Exchange Online service to ensure that emails get delivered as expected. For details, see [Connectors, transport rules, groups, and allow lists for inline protection](connectors-transport-inline.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Make sure that "SPF check: hard fail" is disabled.

    1.  In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & Collaboration → Policies & Rules → Threat policies → Anti-spam** in the **Policies** section.

    2.  On the **Anti-spam policies** screen, click **Anti-spam inbound policy (Default)**.

    3.  In the policy details panel that appears, check whether **SPF record: hard fail** is set to **Off**.

        If no, click **Edit spam threshold and properties**, set **SPF record: hard fail** to **Off**, and click **Save**.

2.  If you have a transport rule that accepts traffic only from specific IP addresses, add the IP addresses of Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to the list.

    To check the transport rules, log on to the Exchange admin center and go to **Mail flow → Rules**.
