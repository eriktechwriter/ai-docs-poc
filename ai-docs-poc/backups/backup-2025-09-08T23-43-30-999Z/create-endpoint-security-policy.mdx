:::warning[Important]

- Policies is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- This feature is not available in all regions.

- Configure your [policy resources](endpoint-security-policy-resources.mdx) before creating a policy.
:::

Create a policy and configure the basic settings to use with assignments to manage your endpoint settings.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Endpoint Security Policies → Policies**.

2.  Click **Create policy**.

    The **Create policy** window appears.

3.  Specify the **Policy name**.

    Trend Micro recommends using a name that is easy to search and identify the purpose of the policy.

4.  Configure the initial settings for the security modules.

    When creating the policy, the default settings are automatically selected. Enabling a security module applies the recommended settings.

    :::note

    Some features require allocating credits when you assign an policy to your endpoints.
    :::

5.  Click **Create**.

    The policy is created and saved, and the **Policy Settings** window appears.

6.  Configure the security modules.

    :::warning[Important]

    Navigating between the security modules or leaving the **Policy Settings** screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click **Save** before leaving the current screen.
    :::

    - Click **Save** to save and continue editing.

    - Click **Save and exit** to save your settings and exit to **Policies**.

    - Click **Discard and exit** to reject your changes and exit to **Policies**. This does not delete a newly created policy.

    For more information, see [Edit a policy and security modules](configure-security-features.mdx).

7.  When you have finished configuring the security modules, click **Save and exit**.
