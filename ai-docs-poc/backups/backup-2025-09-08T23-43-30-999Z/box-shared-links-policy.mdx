:::: {role="main"}
Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection pre-defines a separate Data Loss Prevention policy that enables the Box administrator to manage shared links to content stored in your organization's Box environment. This helps reduce the risk of undesirable access to your organization's sensitive data through accidental creation of shared links by users.

:::note

In this release, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports control over open shared links only. Open shared links are those set to publicly accessible and no Box account sign-in required.
:::

This policy is independent of the other Data Loss Prevention policies for Box and cannot be prioritized.

New customers can use this policy right after granting Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Box; existing users need to go to **Administrations â†’ Service Account** to recreate an access token for Box before you can enable this policy.

To allow creation of open shared links to any file or folder across your organization's Box environment, disable this policy. By default, this policy is disabled. When enabled, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection monitors the creation of shared links to files and folders in your organization's Box user accounts, and upon detection, allows the creation or removes the link based on the action configured by the administrator in the policy.

This policy is designed to apply to all Box user accounts in your organization. Configure the policy to exclude certain user accounts and items (files and folders) from this policy, that is, to allow creating open shared links to specified files and folders under specified user accounts.

Before using this policy, be aware of the following limitations:

- Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection does not monitor the creation of open shared links to files that reside right under the root path **/All Files** of a Box user account.

- For the folders that reside right under the root path **/All Files** of a Box user account, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection monitors the creation of open shared links to a maximum of 1,000 of them.

- Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection does not handle the open shared links already created before this policy is configured and enabled.

- Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection does not support manual scan for this policy.

- This policy cannot be duplicated or deleted.
