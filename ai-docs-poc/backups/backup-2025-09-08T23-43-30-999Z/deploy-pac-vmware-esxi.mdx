Connect your VMware ESXi applications with Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access and prevent unauthorized intrusions.

Private Access Connectors connect your internal applications with Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access, which allows you to control access to sensitive corporate resources. To ensure high availability (HA) and facilitate load-balancing on high traffic apps, install and group together at least 2 connectors in each environment. Before attempting to deploy the Private Access Connector, ensure that your environment meets the minimum [system requirements](pa-connector-system-reqs.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Private Access Configuration**.

2.  For customers that need to create a new connector group, click **Add Private Access Connector Group**.

    1.  Provide a unique name and description for the group.

    2.  Click **Save**.

3.  Locate your **Connector group** name in the list and click the **New connector** (![](/images/add_connector=683f3c84-a774-40c0-bd9b-4663fcd2b53f.webp)) icon.

    The **Private Access Connector Virtual Appliance** panel appears.

4.  Select **VMware ESXi** from the **Platform** list.

5.  Click **Download Disk Image** to download the OVA file.

    Verify that the file name and extension are: `TrendMicroVisionOne-PrivateAccessConnector.ova`

6.  Copy the **Registration token** for later use.

    :::warning[Important]

    The **Registration token** is only valid for 7 days. If the token expires, you must start again.
    :::

7.  In your VMware environment, create the virtual machine.

    :::warning[Important]

    The steps contained in these instructions were valid as of July 2022 for the vSphere Client.
    :::

    1.  Sign in to the web vSphere Client, click **ACTIONS**, and then click **Deploy OVF Template...**.

        The **Deploy OVF Template** screen appears.

    2.  Under **Select an OVF template**, click **Local file**, select the OVA file downloaded from the Trend Vision One console, and then click **NEXT**.

    3.  Under **Select a name and folder**, specify a unique name and target location for the Private Access Connector virtual appliance, and then click **NEXT**.

    4.  Under **Select a computer resource**, select a destination computer resource and click **NEXT**.

    5.  Under **Review details**, verify the template details and click **NEXT**.

    6.  Under **Select storage**, select the disk location and click **NEXT**.

    7.  Under **Select networks**, select a destination network and click **NEXT**.

    8.  Under **Ready to complete**, review and confirm the settings and click **FINISH**.

        :::note

        The process may take around two minutes to complete.
        :::

8.  Click the green **Power On** button on the top to power on the virtual machine, and then click the console button to open the virtual machine console.

9.  Sign in to the Private Access Connector virtual appliance with the default credentials.

    User name: `admin`

    Password: `saseztna`

10. Enter the Command Line Interface (CLI), run the following command, and then press the **Enter** key to change your password:

    `passwd`

    The default password is `saseztna`. Your new password cannot be the same as the default password.

    The **admin** user and privileged mode share the same password.

11. Type `enable` and then press the **Enter** key to enter privileged mode. Provide the updated password when asked.

    The command prompt changes from **\>** to **\#**.

12. Use the CLI to configure the required network settings.

    After the Private Access Connector is installed, the default IP assignment method for your Ethernet interface is DHCP.

    To view the interface information, run the following command:

    `ifconfig`

    If your organization does not use a DHCP server, manually configure the static IP address, static route, and DNS server for your interface. For more information on available commands, see [Private Access Connector CLI commands](private-access-connector-cli.mdx).

13. (Optional) Run the following command to change the time zone of the Private Access Connector:

    `configure timezone <timezone>`

    The default time zone is **America/Los_Angeles**.

14. Check whether the Private Access Connector can connect to the NTP server `0.pool.ntp.org`.

    The Connector requires connectivity to an NTP server to synchronize its clock. By default, Trend Vision One uses the public NTP server `0.pool.ntp.org`. You can also configure the Connector to connect to another public NTP server or a local NTP server within your organization.

    Run the following command to configure the NTP server: `configure ntp server <address>`

    :::note

    To use public NTP servers, make sure that your firewall configuration allows outbound UDP traffic on port 123.
    :::

15. Run the following command to register the Private Access Connector virtual appliance to Trend Vision One:

    `register <registration_token>`

    You can obtain the token from the same screen you downloaded the virtual appliance on Trend Vision One.

    :::note

    - If your environment uses a local Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, make sure the NTP server synchronizes with the local time for successful registration.

    - Trend Micro recommends using an SSH client to easily copy and paste the registration token.
    :::

16. Use the CLI to configure other settings, if required.

    For more information on available commands, see [Private Access Connector CLI commands](private-access-connector-cli.mdx).

    After successful deployment, the Private Access Connector virtual appliance appears under the corresponding connector group on the **Private Access Connectors** tab.
