        You may alternatively upload the pre-generated XML file downloaded from the **Managed Configuration Enrollment for Android and iOS/iPadOS Devices** screen or create your own XML file for upload using the following XML code:

        ``` codeblock
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
        <plist version="1.0">

            <key>enrollmentKey</key>
            <string>placeholder</string>
        </dict>
        </plist>
        ```

        Replace the placeholder value with the enrollment key shown on the **Managed Configuration Enrollment for Android and iOS/iPadOS Devices** screen.
