Before continuing with further Anti-Malware configuration steps, test real-time and manual/scheduled scans to ensure they're working correctly.

- Test manual and scheduled scans

## Test real-time scans {#test-real-time-scans}

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Make sure the real-time scan is enabled and that a configuration is selected.

2.  Go to the [EICAR site](http://www.eicar.org/) and download the anti-malware test file. This standardized file will test the real-time scan's anti-virus capabilities. The file should be quarantined.

3.  In the Server & Workload Protection console, go to **Events & Reports → Anti-Malware Events** to verify the record of the EICAR file detection. If the detection is recorded, the Anti-Malware real-time scans are working correctly.

## Test manual and scheduled scans {#test-manual-and-scheduled-scans}

:::note

Before you begin, make sure the real-time scan is disabled before testing manual/scheduled scans.
