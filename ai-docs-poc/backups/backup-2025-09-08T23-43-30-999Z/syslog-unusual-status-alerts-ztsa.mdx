::: {role="main"}
July 3, 2023—Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access now maintains system logs to provide summaries about Internet Access On-Premises Gateway events that occurred, including gateway connection status change, service version update, and SSO authentication proxy status change.

You can also configure alerts to send notifications when the status of an on-premises gateway changes to "Unhealthy", or when the on-premises gateway that serves as the authentication proxy for SSO is disconnected from your on-premises Active Directory server. For more information, see [Internet Access gateways and corporate network locations](corporate-network-locations-ia.mdx).
