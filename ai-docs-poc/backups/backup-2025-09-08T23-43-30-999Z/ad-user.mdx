View details of users in your organization and information related to their security.

The **User** tab allows you to view details of all user accounts in your organization. In Active Directory, user accounts are available for human users or programs/services to access resources in a Windows domain. For more information, see [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/what-is-a-user).
