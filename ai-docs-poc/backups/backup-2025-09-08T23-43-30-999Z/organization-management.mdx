Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection allows the administrator to manage organizations where they grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to a cloud service on multiple tenants. In this way, you can secure all the tenants' services you manage and switch quickly between organizations using one single CLP/LMP account.

After you log on to the management console, a default organization is created. You can rename the organization but cannot remove it.

You can also create more organizations based on your needs.

The steps outlined below illustrate how to manage your organizations.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Email and Collaboration Security Operations → Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection → Administration → Organization Management**.

2.  On the **Organization Management** screen that appears, perform the following tasks:

    - Add an organization.

      1.  Click **Add**.

      2.  On the **Add Organization** screen that appears, specify an organization name (required) and description (optional), and then click **Save**.

          :::note

          The organization name cannot exceed 32 characters, and the description cannot exceed 128 characters.

          A maximum of 20 organizations is supported.
          :::

          To grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to services under an added organization, in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, go to **Administration → Service Account** and grant access to the services that you are going to manage under that organization.

          :::note

          You can grant access to a service for one tenant under only one organization. For example, if you have granted access to the Exchange Online service account for Azure AD tenant A under one organization, you are not able to grant access for Microsoft Entra ID tenant A again under another organization.
          :::

          When you return to the **Organization Management** screen, you can see the services to which you have granted Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access under that organization in the **Services with access granted** column.

    - Remove an organization.

      1.  Select an organization and click **Remove**.

      2.  Click **OK**.

          :::note

          You can remove only one organization at a time.

          You cannot remove an organization if it has:

          - Services with access granted

          - Pending or failed tasks

          - Authentication tokens generated for automation APIs

          - Exchange Server registered to it
