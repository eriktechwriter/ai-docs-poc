The **Object Details** tab displays the same information as the **Root Cause Analysis** tab, but presents the information as a table. It also organizes the objects into the following tabs:

- **Objects**: Objects involved in the execution of the matched object, grouped by their parent processes. Click â–¶ to expand the list.

- **Noteworthy events**: Objects in the chain that are possibly malicious, based on existing Trend Micro intelligence

- **File events**: Objects in the chain that are files

- **Registry events**: Objects in the chain that are registry keys, data and entries

- **IP address / DNS events**: Objects that are IP addresses or DNS events

The table provides the following details:
