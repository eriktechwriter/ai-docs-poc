Add custom detection signals that are unique and critical to your environment.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Detection Signals** tab, click **Add**.

2.  Specify a name for the signal and optionally provide a description in the **Basic Properties** area. The name can help clearly identify what signals deviating from normal behaviors that you want to detect.

3.  In the **Signal Definition** area, define the signal.

    1.  Select a condition field from the drop-down list.

    2.  Select the desired operator from the drop-down list.

        Available operators include both integer value comparison operators and string value matching operators. For example, **≤** means that the condition field contains an integer that less than or equal to the specified integer value.

    3.  Enter or select the desired value as a string or integer if necessary.

        The following table describes the supported conditions

        <table>
        <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 33%" />
        <col style="width: 17%" />
