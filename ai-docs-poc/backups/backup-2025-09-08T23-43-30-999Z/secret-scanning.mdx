June 25, 2024—Container Security now supports secret scanning for container images. Secret scanning identifies sensitive and confidential data, such as passwords and API keys, that have inadvertently been publicly exposed. You can define whether to allow images to be deployed based on their scan results and configure the validity period of scan results.
