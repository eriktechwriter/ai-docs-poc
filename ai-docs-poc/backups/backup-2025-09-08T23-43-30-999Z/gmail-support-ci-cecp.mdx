March 21, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection extends Correlated Intelligence to Gmail service protection. Administrators can configure Correlated Intelligence settings in ATP policies for Gmail. This helps find security risks and anomalies in their Gmail emails using predefined and custom correlation rules and detection signals.

The warning banner feature is not available for Gmail.
