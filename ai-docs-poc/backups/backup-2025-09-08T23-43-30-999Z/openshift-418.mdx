Ensure that the certificate authorities file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, in OpenShift 4, the `--client-ca-file` is set to` /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` with ownership `root:root`.

### Audit {#audit}

The Client CA location for the `kubelet` is defined in `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` and is `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` by default.

Run the following command to view the user and group ownership:

``` codeblock
for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
       oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %U:%G
/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
