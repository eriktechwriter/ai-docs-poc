Private GKE clusters require an additional VPC network firewall rule for the `admission-webhook` to work. Follow the instructions in Google Cloud Documentation ([Adding firewall rules for specific use cases](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters)) to add a firewall rule allowing traffic from your masterâ€™s source IP range to the `trendmicro-admission-controller` pod.

When creating the rule, you need to specify the port that allows traffic. The `trendmicro-admission-controller` pod has port `8443` enabled.

The following is an example of the `gcloud` command for adding the firewall rule:

``` codeblock
gcloud compute firewall-rules create "allow-apiserver-to-admission-webhook-8443" \
    --action ALLOW \
    --direction INGRESS \
    --source-ranges ${CONTROL_PLANE_RANGE} \
    --rules tcp:8443 \
    --description="Allow apiserver access to admission webhook pod on port 8443" \
    --target-tags ${TARGET}
```
