October 16, 2023—With the official release of the Forensics app, the Incident Response Evidence Collection playbook now requires credits for evidence collection and uploading to the Forensics app. Users must first configure the data allowance in the Forensics app before setting up the playbook to collect and upload evidence to the Trend Vision One console.

For more information, see [Create Incident Response Evidence Collection playbooks](create-ir-collection-playbooks.mdx).
