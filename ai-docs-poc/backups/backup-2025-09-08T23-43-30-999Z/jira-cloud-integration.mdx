Configure bi-directional updates between Jira Cloud and Trend Vision One Case Management. Configuration requires a Jira administrator account.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Download and install the **Trend Vision One Connector** from the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1237447/trend-vision-one-connector). Follow the instructions in the marketplace installation.

2.  In Jira Cloud, go to **Apps → Trend Vision One Connector**.

3.  Configure the settings for fields and value mapping. Mapping enables Jira and Case Management to bi-directionally sync updates.

    1.  On the **Settings** tab, select the Case Management field value and choose the equivalent Jira field value.

        - Priority Mappings: Matches the case priority level in Case Management to the Jira ticket equivalent. For example, **P1** in Case Management might equal **Highest** in Jira.

        - Status Mappings; Matches the case status in Case Management to the Jira ticket equivalent. For example, **Closed** in Case Management might equal **Done** in Jira.

        - Other Mappings: Matches other Case Management fields like **Case ID**, **Description**, or **Attachment** to equivalent fields in Jira.
