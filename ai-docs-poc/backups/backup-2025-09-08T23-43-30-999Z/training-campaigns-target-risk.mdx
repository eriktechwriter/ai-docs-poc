January 15, 2024—In addition to manually creating training campaigns for your users in the **Security Awareness Training** app, you can now also initiate campaigns from the **Attack Surface Discovery**, **Threat and Exposure Management**, and **Identity Posture** apps. Campaigns initiated from these three apps enable you to provide Security Awareness Training training focused specifically on at-risk users.

When viewing domain accounts in **Attack Surface Discovery**, the context menu now includes the **Create Training Campaign** option.

In **Threat and Exposure Management**, the remediation steps for some types of risk events—such as phishing simulations indicating user accounts might be vulnerable to attack — now include links to create **Security Awareness Training** training.

The **Identity Posture** app's **Identity Summary** screen for highly privileged identities and the highlighted exposure risk events in the **Exposure** tab now also feature a **Create Security Awareness Training Training Campaign** button.
