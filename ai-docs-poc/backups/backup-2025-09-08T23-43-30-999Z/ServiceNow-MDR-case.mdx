January 20, 2025—Managed Services users can now synchronize MDR case information with ServiceNow. To create a ticket profile, go to **Third-Party Integration → Trend Vision One for ServiceNow Ticketing System** and select "MDR case" as the case type. Then go to **XDR Threat Investigation → Managed Services → Settings → Cross-App Management**, enable automatic creation of ServiceNow tickets when MDR cases are created, and select the ticket profile to synchronize the case with ServiceNow.
