Decrypt and inspect encrypted content over HTTPS connections for internet access control.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol with Security (HTTPS) is a combination of HTTP with a network security protocol (such as TLS, Transport Layer Security). HTTPS connection is used for Web applications (such as online banking) that require secured connections to protect sensitive content. Since traditional security devices are unable to decrypt and inspect this content, virus/malware and other threats embedded in HTTPS traffic can pass unobstructed through your security defenses and on to your enterprise network.

The internet access service closes the HTTPS security loophole by decrypting and inspecting encrypted content. While decrypted, data is treated the same way as HTTP traffic to which secure access rules can be applied. Decrypted data is completely secure since it is still in the Internet Access Gateway server's memory. Before leaving the Gateway, the data is encrypted for secure passage to the client's browser.
