August 19, 2025—To support more complex asset organization and improve scalability, Asset Group Management now allows users to create up to 500 asset groups, increased from the previous limit of 30.

Additionally, the maximum number of layers for nested asset groups has been expanded from two levels to ten, enabling more granular organization and control. These enhancements are designed to meet the asset management needs of large-scale deployments and complex operational models.

For more information, see [Asset Group Management](asset-group-management.mdx).
