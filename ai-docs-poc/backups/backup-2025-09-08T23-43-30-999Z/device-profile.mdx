View detailed information about a selected device and take actions to mitigate the device's effect on the Cyber Risk Index.

Available actions:

- Hover over the device name to view critical information about the device, such as the current risk score, [asset criticality](asset-criticality.mdx), and significant [profile tags](asset-profile-tags.mdx). To manually modify the criticality of the device, click **Modify Criticality**, select a criticality source of **Custom**, and select the criticality of the asset.

- Select the **Custom Tags** tab while hovering over the device name to view and manage custom tags assigned to the device.

- Click the actions icon ( ![](/images/options=ddb0b67f-0654-4aa5-8bc7-48ec554c5448.webp) ) to access actions for the selected asset. Using this menu, you can view the Asset Risk Graph, add the device to an exception list, or take [response actions](response-actions-cloudposture.mdx).

The following table describes the tabs available on the device profile screen.

:::warning[Important]

Customers with XDR sensor entitlements that have not allocated credits to Cyber Risk Exposure Management can only see the **Risk Score** widget of the **Risk Assessment** tab and access the **Users** and **Asset Profile** tabs.
