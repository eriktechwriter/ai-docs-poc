View your TippingPoint devices managed by a connected TippingPoint Security Management System (SMS) console and configure the Network Sensor function.

**Network Inventory** allows you to view your TippingPoint TPS and vTPS devices managed by a connected TippingPoint SMS and get important device information, such as device and connection health, and Digital Vaccine versions.

For more information on how to connect TippingPoint SMS consoles, see [TippingPoint SMS connection guides](tippingpoint-sms-connection-guides.mdx).

:::warning[Important]

- This feature is not available in all regions.

- Intrusion Prevention Filter management capabilities are coming soon.

- The inventory screen appears empty if your connected TippingPoint SMS is not managing any TippingPoint TPS or vTPS devices.

<ul>
<li><p>5600 TXE devices reduced from 10 Gbps to 5 Gbps</p></li>
<li><p>8600 TXE devices reduced from 40 Gbps to 20 Gbps</p></li>
<li><p>9200 TXE devices reduced from 100 Gbps to 60 Gbps</p></li>
</ul>
