- Error when running the back-end script
- Error: Backend configuration changed
- Error: Error acquiring the state lock
- Error code: 403 User Disabled when running back-end script
- Error code: 403 Access Denied when running back-end script

## Error when running the back-end script {#error-when-running-the-back-end-script}

When attempting to execute the command `bash script.sh create_backend` to install back-end components, you see an error containing one of the following elements:

- Error includes `StatusCode: 409`

- Error includes the string `OSTObjectAlreadyExist Requested table already exists`

If you encounter one or both of these errors, the back-end components have already been installed and deployed to the target account and target region. You can safely proceed with deploying the Terraform script.

## Error: Backend configuration changed {#error-backend-configuration-changed}

The error `Backend configuration changed` occurs when there is an attempt to change the back-end region where Terraform files are stored. This might occur if you are attempting to redeploy the back-end components and Terraform script to a different region on an account which is already connected.

To resolve the error, complete the following steps.

1.  Destroy all Trend Vision One resources in the previous back-end region.

2.  Remove the Terraform installation package using the command `rm -r ~/cloud-account-management-terraform-package`.

3.  Follow the steps in [Adding an Alibaba Cloud account](adding-alibaba-cloud-account.mdx) to redeploy the Terraform script.

## Error: Error acquiring the state lock {#error-error-acquiring-the-state-lock}

This error occurs when the Terraform installation does not exit normally and the state file remains locked.

To resolve the error, complete the following steps:

1.  In the error message, under `Lock Info` locate and copy the `ID` string.

2.  Run the command `export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY=${ACCESS_KEY_ID}`

3.  Run the command `export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY=${ACCESS_KEY_SECRET}`

4.  Run the command `export ALICLOUD_SECURITY_TOKEN=${SECURITY_TOKEN}`

5.  Run the command `terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>`

    Replace `<LOCK_ID>` with the string you copied from the error message.

## Error code: 403 User Disabled when running back-end script {#error-code-403-user-disabled-when-running-back-end-script}

This error occurs when the Table Store (OTS) and OSS services have not been activated on your Alibaba account. Activate these services and run the back-end script again.

## Error code: 403 Access Denied when running back-end script {#error-code-403-access-denied-when-running-back-end-script}

This error occurs if you are attempting to deploy the back-end resources to a region on an account that already has back-end resources deployed to another region.

For example, if the back-end resources were previously deployed to `us-east-1` and you attempt to deploy the back-end resources to `us-west-1`, the deployment script fails with the 403 Access Denied error.

To resolve the error, complete the following steps.

1.  Destroy all Trend Vision One resources in the previous back-end region.

2.  Remove the Terraform installation package using the command `rm -r ~/cloud-account-management-terraform-package`.

3.  Follow the steps in [Adding an Alibaba Cloud account](adding-alibaba-cloud-account.mdx) to redeploy the Terraform script to the preferred region.
