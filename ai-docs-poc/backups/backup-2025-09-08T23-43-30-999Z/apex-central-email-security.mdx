Trend Micro Trend Micro Apex Central consolidates your organization's suspicious object information and synchronizes the suspicious objects among integrated managed products. After Cloud Email Gateway Protection is registered to Trend Micro Apex Central, Trend Micro Apex Central automatically synchronizes the suspicious URLs, file SHA-1 hashes, and file SHA-256 hashes with Cloud Email Gateway Protection at a scheduled time interval. In addition to its own scanning mechanism, Cloud Email Gateway Protection cancan leverage the suspicious objects to detect known or potentially malicious files and URLs during scanning.

For more information about how Trend Micro Apex Central manages suspicious object lists, see the Trend Micro Apex Central Administrator's Guide.
