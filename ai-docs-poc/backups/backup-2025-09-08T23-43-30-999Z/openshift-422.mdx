Disable anonymous requests to the Kubelet server.

When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests.

:::note

By default, anonymous access is set to `false`.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

Anonymous requests will be rejected.

### Audit {#audit}

In OpenShift 4, the Kubernetes configuration file is managed by the Machine Config Operator and `anonymous-auth` is set to `false` by default.

Run the following command on each node to the configuration of anonymous authentication:

``` codeblock
for node in $(oc get nodes -ojsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do
oc get --raw /api/v1/nodes/$node/proxy/configz | jq
'.kubeletconfig.authentication.anonymous.enabled'
done
```

Verify that the configuration for each node returns `false`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Create a `kubeletconfig` to explicitly disable anonymous authentication. Examples of how to do this can be found in the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.mdx).
