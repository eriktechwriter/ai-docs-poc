Scan your AWS EBS, ECR, and Lambda resources for malware to help identify threats, prioritize remediation efforts, and secure cloud workloads.

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection provides anti-malware scanning for potential threats, such as viruses, Trojans, and spyware, in your AWS EBS, ECR, and Lambda resources. Anti-malware scanning is not enabled for AWS by default. You may enable the feature at any time in [Cloud Accounts](cloud-accounts.mdx) for existing AWS accounts or when deploying a new CloudFormation template. If you enable anti-malware scanning on an existing AWS account, scanning begins during the next daily scan. Scan times are not configurable.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → AWS** and click **Add Account**.

2.  Choose CloudFormation as the deployment method, select **Single AWS Account**, and click **Next**.

3.  Specify the general information for the account and click **Next**. For more details, see [Adding an AWS account using CloudFormation](adding-aws-account.mdx).

    The **Features and Permissions** screen appears.

4.  In **Features and Permissions**, enable **Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection** and select the deployment regions.

    :::note

    Selected regions are the regions where Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection is deployed, not necessarily the region of your AWS account. You may select multiple deployment regions.

6.  Select the AWS resource types you wish to include in anti-malware scans. By default, no resource types are selected.

    Enabling anti-malware scanning increases your AWS operational costs. For more information, see [Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection estimated deployment costs for AWS](deployment-costs.mdx).
