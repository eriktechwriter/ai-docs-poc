The **Log Export Query** screen enables you to query the status of log export tasks and configure notification settings on completed tasks. Cloud Email Gateway Protection maintains up to 7 days of log export tasks.

:::warning[Important]

This screen only lists the export tasks initiated by clicking **Export All** on the **Mail Tracking** or **Policy Events** screen.
:::

The **Log Export Query** screen includes the **Log Export Tasks** and **Notification Setting** tabs.

The **Log Export Tasks** tab is designed for you to query the status of log export tasks and provides the following search criteria:

- **Log Type**: The type of log records you have exported.

  - **All**

  - **Mail tracking logs**

  - **Policy event logs**

After a query is performed, Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides a list of log export tasks that satisfy the criteria. For the tasks whose **Status** is **Completed**, click **Download CSV File** to download the queried log records to a CSV file.

On the **Notification Setting** tab, specify whether you want to turn on or off notifications on completed export tasks. Turning on the notifications requires you entering at least one email address in the **Email Address** field. You can enter multiple email addresses separated by semicolons.
