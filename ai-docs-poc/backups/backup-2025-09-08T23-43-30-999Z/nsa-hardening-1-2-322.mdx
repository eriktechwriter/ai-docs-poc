ResourceQuotas are restrictions placed on the aggregate resource usage for an entire namespace, such as limits placed on total CPU and memory usage. If a user tries to create a Pod that violates a LimitRange or ResourceQuota policy, the Pod creation fails.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command and review ResourceQuota policies:

``` codeblock
kubectl get resourcequotas --all-namespaces
```

Add ResourceQuota policies to limit resource usage.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Create a ResourceQuota policy with memory and CPU quota per each namespace.

ResourceQuota objects to limit aggregate resource usage within a namespace are created by applying a YAML file to a namespace or specifying requirements in the configuration file of Pods. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage%02resources/quota-memory-cpu-namespace/%3E).

Configuration file for a namespace:

``` codeblock
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: example-cpu-mem-resourcequota
spec:
  hard:
  requests.cpu: “1”
  requests.memory: 1Gi
  limits.cpu: “2”
  limits.memory: 2Gi
```

This ResourceQuota can be applied with:

``` codeblock
kubectl apply -f example-cpu-mem-resourcequota.yaml --namespace=<insert-namespace-here>
```

This ResourceQuota places the following constraints on the chosen namespace. Every container must have the following:

- A memory request, memory limit, CPU request, and CPU limit
- Aggregate memory request for all containers should not exceed 1 GB
- Total memory limit for all containers should not exceed 2 GB
- Aggregate CPU request for all containers should not exceed 1 CPU
- Total CPU limit for all containers should not exceed 2 CPUs
