::: {role="main"}
Extract compressed files and scan the contents for malware. When you enable the scan, you specify the maximum size and number of files to extract (large files can affect performance). You also specify the levels of compression to inspect so that you can scan compressed files that reside inside compressed files. Level 1 compression is a single compressed file. Compressed files inside that file are level two. You can scan a maximum of 6 compression levels, however higher levels can affect performance.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Open the properties of the malware scan configuration.

2.  On the **Advanced** tab, select **Scan compressed files**.

3.  Specify the maximum size of content files to extract, in MB, the levels of compression to scan, and the maximum number of files to extract.

4.  Click **OK**.
