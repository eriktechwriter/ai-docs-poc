October 21, 2024—Cyber Risk Exposure Management prioritizes the most critical vulnerabilities across your entire attack surface, allowing you to focus your remediation efforts. However, visibility into lower impact CVEs is now available for containers, cloud VMs, and serverless functions, providing you the vulnerability information you needs for compliance or internal audits. View lower impact CVEs in the Vulnerabilities section of Threat and Exposure Management or Exposure Overview in Cyber Risk Overview.
