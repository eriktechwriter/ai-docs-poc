The **Attachment size is** criteria allows you to create policy rules that take actions on messages based on the size of any attachments to the message.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Scanning Criteria** tab, click **Advanced**.

2.  Select the **Attachment size is** criteria.

3.  Select **\>** or **\<=** from the comparison drop-down list.

    - Select **\>** to apply the policy rule to attachments that are larger than the specified size.

    - Select **\<=** to apply the policy rule to attachments that are smaller than or equal to the specified size.

    For example, **\<= 10 MB** applies the policy rule to all messages that are equal to or smaller than 10 megabytes.

4.  Type a value for the size.

5.  Select a unit of measurement from the following choices:

    - **B**: Bytes

    - **KB**: Kilobytes

    - **MB**: Megabytes

    :::note

    The **Attachment size is** criteria is applied to the total size of each attachment.
    :::

    For example, if a message contained two attachments, one a 3 MB attachment and the other a 1 MB attachment, a policy rule that deletes attachments over 2 MB would delete only the 3 MB attachment. The other attachment would not be deleted.
