::: {role="main"}
You can deploy Container Security along with AWS Fargate to your Amazon EKS cluster. You need to add a cluster with **Runtime Security** enabled, and have the Helm chart deploy the "`fargate-injector`" into the Amazon EKS cluster.

`trendmicro-security` runs as a sidecar and attaches to the application like a debugger in order to monitor suspicious events. As a result, the business application might be affected in the Fargate environment when `trendmicro-security` stops.

When deploying Container Security with EKS Fargate, you should be aware of the following:

- The container must have internet access.

- Each Fargate node uses 8MB shared memory, and each Fargate node has a limit of 64MB

- Container Security uses ptrace to inspect the containers. If you are also using ptrace, the monitoring may not work.

- Monitored programs SUID and SGID have no effect.

- Additional CPU resources are required for the following:

  - CPU: An extra 1 for each container

  - Memory: +32MiB for each container

  - The injected sidecar requires 1 vCPU and 1024MiB memory

- Mitigation of runtime rulesets only supports "Log" and "Terminate".

  :::note

  "Isolate" requires Calico CNI to be installed, but Fargate with EKS currently does not support Calico. For more information, see [Installing the Calico network policy engine add-on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.mdx)
