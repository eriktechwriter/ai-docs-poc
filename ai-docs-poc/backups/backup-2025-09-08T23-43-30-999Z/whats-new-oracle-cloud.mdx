August 18, 2025—Trend Vision One now supports Oracle Cloud compartments for the following features:

- **Cloud Accounts**: You can now connect your Oracle Compartments in Cloud Accounts to monitor your Oracle cloud assets for risk. For more information, see [Add an Oracle Cloud compartment](adding-oracle-cloud-compartment.mdx).

- **Cyber Risk Exposure Management**:

  - Connected Oracle Cloud compartments are now viewable in the Cloud Assets tab in **Attack Surface Discovery**, including Asset Profile and Cloud Risk Graph views. For more information, see [Cloud assets](cloud-assets.mdx).

  - You can evaluate potential attack paths in your connected Oracle Compartments in **Attack Path Prediction**. For more information, see [Attack Path Prediction](attack-path-predict.mdx).

- **Cloud Risk Management**:

  - Monitor and manage risks for your Oracle Cloud compartment in **Cloud Security Posture**. View your connected Oracle Cloud compartments on the Cloud Overview tab, and group your Oracle Cloud compartments into projects. For more information, see [Cloud Security Posture](cloud-overview-dashboard.mdx).

  - The **Misconfiguration and Compliance** (CSPM) app has been updated with forty rules to scan Oracle Cloud compartments. These rules are mapped to the CIS Oracle Foundations benchmark, which is now supported in Cloud Risk Management. For more information, see [Misconfiguration and Compliance](cloud-identity-dashboard-view.mdx) and [Cloud Risk Management](cloud-risk-management.mdx).
