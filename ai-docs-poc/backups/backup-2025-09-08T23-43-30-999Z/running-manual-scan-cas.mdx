Running a manual scan performs an on-demand scan of targets based on the selected policy configuration.

For details, see [Manual scan](real-time-demand-scanning.mdx).

:::note

Manual scan is not applicable for Microsoft Teams (Chat).
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Add at least one Advanced Threat Protection or Data Loss Prevention policy.

    For details, see [Adding advanced threat protection policies](adding-atp-policies.mdx) and [Adding Data Loss Prevention policies](adding-dlp-policies.mdx).

2.  In the **Actions** column of a policy, click ![](/images/manual_scan_icon=20240508142731.webp).

3.  Under **Scan Type**, select whether to scan the service data with or without taking actions on any violation.

    :::note

    The **Scan only** type applies to Microsoft 365 services and Gmail only.

    For Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive, **Scan Type** does not appear. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection always scans the service data and takes actions configured in the policy on any violation.
    :::

4.  Under **Scope**, select the time range to scan.

    You can specify the time range down to minute.

5.  Under **Report Recipients**, type the email addresses of the users to receive the scan report.
