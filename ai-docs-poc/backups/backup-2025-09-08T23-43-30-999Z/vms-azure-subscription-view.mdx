If you connected an Azure subscription using an older method before connection management moved to **Cloud Accounts**, some virtual machine instances might not appear in **Computers** or **Endpoint Inventory**. To resolve the issue, go to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → Azure** and update any legacy connections.

For more information about updating legacy Azure connections, see [Updating a legacy Azure connection](updating-legacy-azure-connection.mdx).
