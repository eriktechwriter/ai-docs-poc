### Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

To configure outbound connectors, ensure that you have an Microsoft 365 administrator account.

Some organizations use Microsoft 365 to remotely host their email architecture, allowing Microsoft to manage the day-to-day aspects of maintaining their email servers. Cloud Email Gateway Protection integrates with Microsoft 365 to provide additional security and benefits.

Configure Microsoft 365 connectors to allow email traffic to and from Cloud Email Gateway Protection MTAs.

:::warning[Important]

Consult the Microsoft 365 help for information about adding connectors. Some Microsoft 365 plans do not offer connectors.
