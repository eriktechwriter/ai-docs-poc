Administrators can copy the settings from an existing policy, create a new policy with the same settings, and deploy the settings to different endpoints or managed products.

:::note

It is not possible to copy the settings of a child **Apex One Agent** policy. To determine whether the **Apex One Agent** policy is a child or a parent, check the **Parent Policy** column. A clickable value displays if the policy is a child, and N/A if otherwise.
