### Email Messages with "Do Not Forward" Flag Not Scanned {#email-messages-with-do-not-forward-flag-not-scanned}

If a user composing an email chooses the **Do not forward** option from **Options → Permission**, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection cannot scan email message contents.

### Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection Failed to Scan any Files in Microsoft 365 Services (Applicable to Access Grant Using a Delegate Account) {#cloud-email-and-collaboration-protection-failed-to-scan-any-files-in-microsoft-365-services-applicable-to-access-grant-using-a-delegate-account}

Microsoft provides an option for administrators to choose whether to disable basic authentication requests and allow only modern authentication to access SharePoint Online/OneDrive, in the purpose of helping protect the services from brute force or password spray attacks. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection uses basic authentication when accessing SharePoint Online/OneDrive services by using a Delegate Account, that is, combination of a username and a password. If the administrator enables basic authentication when granting access but disables it after that, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will not be able to pass the access control on the SharePoint Online/OneDrive side and scanning will fail.

To ensure proper scanning by Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, make sure to always enable basic authentication for SharePoint Online/OneDrive as follows:

On the **Microsoft 365 admin center** page, go to **Admin → Admin centers → SharePoint → access control**, and click **Allow** under **Control access from apps that don't use modern authentication**.

This issue does not affect Microsoft Teams.
