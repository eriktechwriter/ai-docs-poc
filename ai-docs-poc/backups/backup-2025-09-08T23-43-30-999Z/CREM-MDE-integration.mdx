June 30, 2025—You can now extend the capabilities of Cyber Risk Exposure Management to assets in your environment covered by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Integrating Microsoft Defender for Endpoint via an Azure subscription in Cloud accounts enables you to gain insights into the security configuration of your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint-managed assets in Cyber Risk Overview, visibility over discovered assets in Attack Surface Discovery, and information on asset misconfigurations in Threat and Exposure Management. To learn how to integrate your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data for use in Cyber Risk Exposure Management, see [Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Log Collection](ms-defender-endpoint-log-collection.mdx).
