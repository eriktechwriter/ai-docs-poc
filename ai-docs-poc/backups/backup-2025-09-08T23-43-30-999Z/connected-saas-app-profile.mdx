Connected SaaS apps are SaaS apps managed by your organization and analyzed by Trend Vision One.

Connected SaaS apps are apps managed by your organization that you have connected to Trend Vision One through supported data sources in [Third-Party Integration](third-party-integration.mdx). You can view the connection status of the contributing data sources in [Cyber Risk Exposure Management data sources](ASRM-data-sources.mdx). Connected SaaS app data gives you greater visibility into and control over your SaaS security posture.

Data sources that contribute to connected SaaS app analysis include:

- Office 365

- Microsoft Entra ID

- Salesforce

A connected SaaS app profile provides the following information about a particular connected SaaS app and the usage of the app in your organization.
