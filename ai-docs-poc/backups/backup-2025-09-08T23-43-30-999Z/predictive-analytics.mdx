View information about the **Predictive analytics** risk factor, which pinpoints potential future threats you can proactively address to strengthen your security posture.

The **Predictive analytics** risk factor is based on exposures detected on your assets that could potentially facilitate an attack in the future. The predictive analytics risk factor contributes to your [exposure level](exposure-overview.mdx). Generated risk events can be viewed and managed in **Threat and Exposure Management**.

When viewing risk events, click the number in the case column to view current cases involving the specified risk event. Click the options icon (![](/images/options=ddb0b67f-0654-4aa5-8bc7-48ec554c5448.webp)) to open a new case for the risk event or add the case to an existing risk event.

:::warning[Important]

Addressing attack path risk events does not necessarily address the root cause of the risk. If you only address the attack path risk event without addressing risk events on the entry and target assets, the attack path risk event may be generated again. Remediate entry and target risk events first to avoid regenerating the attack path risk event.
