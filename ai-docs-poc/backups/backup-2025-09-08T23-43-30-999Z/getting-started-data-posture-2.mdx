Before you can use Data Security Posture, you must ensure the following:

- You have updated to the Foundation Services release of Trend Vision One, which was released on July 3, 2023 and provides strengthened centralized management capabilities. For more information, including important update considerations, see [Update Trend Vision One to the Foundation Services release](update-foundation-services-release.mdx).

- You have an AWS account or Azure subscription added to Trend Vision One.

Data Security Posture provides two methods for scanning cloud assets for sensitive data:

- Monitor sensitive data by enabling Data Security Posture on your AWS and Azure accounts. This method does not require that you configure a third-party solution, and offers a complete solution within Trend Vision One. For more information, see [Enable Data Security Posture for your AWS cloud accounts](data-posture-for-aws-accounts.mdx) and [Enable Data Security Posture on an Azure subscription](data-security-posture-azure.mdx).

- Monitor sensitive data using AWS Macie. Use this method if you are already using AWS Macie and you want to use AWS Macie in addition to enabling Data Security Posture on your AWS accounts. Data Security Posture integrates with Amazon Macie to scan S3 buckets for sensitive data and potential data leak issues. To learn how to enable Amazon Macie, see [Enable Amazon Macie](enable-amazon-macie.mdx)

To enable Data Security Posture:
