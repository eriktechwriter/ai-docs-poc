Quickly add your accounts to Cloud Accounts by connecting your AWS Organization.

Cloud Accounts supports adding accounts managed by your AWS Organization by deploying features to the root account or organizational unit (OU) level. Adding your AWS Organization to Cloud Accounts provides a quick way to allow Trend Vision One access to your managed cloud accounts to provide security and visibility into your cloud assets. Some Cloud Account features have limited support for AWS regions. For more information, see [AWS supported regions and limitations](aws-supported-regions-limitations.mdx).

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with administrator privileges, including permissions to create and manage AWS CloudFormation stack sets for the AWS Organization you wish to connect. For more information, see [AWS CloudFormation StackSets and AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-cloudformation.mdx).

:::warning[Important]

- The steps are valid for the AWS console as of November 2023.

- Adding an AWS organization forces accounts managed by that organization to apply the same settings configured for the entire organization. Settings cannot be modified for individual accounts added as part of an organization.

  To apply different configurations to individual accounts managed by an AWS organization, you must add those accounts separately. Either add the accounts before adding your AWS organization, or use the **OrganizationExcludedAccounts** parameter to exclude those accounts from the stack deployment.

- The Cloud Accounts app currently only supports connecting organizations using the CloudFormation stack template.

- Due to limitations of AWS, StackSets does not deploy resources to your management account. To add your management account, see [Adding an AWS account using CloudFormation](adding-aws-account.mdx).

  For more information, see [Why is my management account not visible after connecting my AWS organization?](why--management-account-not-visible.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Sign in to the Trend Vision One console.

2.  In a separate browser tab, sign into your AWS organization account.

3.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → AWS**.

4.  Click **Add Account**.

    The **Add AWS Account** window appears.

5.  Specify the Deployment Type.

    1.  For **Deployment Method**, select **CloudFormation**.

    2.  For account type, select **AWS Organization**.

    3.  Click **Next**.

6.  Specify the general information for the organization.

    1.  Specify the **Account name** to display in the Cloud Accounts app.

        Once the AWS Organization is added, all member accounts without a previously specified alias in AWS receive an automatically generated name in the Cloud Accounts app.

    2.  Add a **Description** to display in Cloud Accounts.

    3.  Select the AWS region for CloudFormation template deployment.

        :::note

        The default region is your Trend Vision One region.

        Some features and permissions have limited support for some AWS regions. For more information, see [AWS supported regions and limitations](aws-supported-regions-limitations.mdx).
        :::

    4.  If you have more than one Server & Workload Protection Manager instance, select the instance to associate with the connected account.

        :::note

        - If you have one Server & Workload Protection Manager instance, the account is automatically associated with that instance.
        :::

    5.  To add custom tags to the resources deployed by Trend Vision One, select **Resource tagging** and specify the key-value pairs.

        Click **Create a new tag** to add up to three tags.

        :::note

        - Keys can be up to 128 characters long, and cannot start with `aws`.

        - Values can be up to 256 characters long.
        :::

    6.  Click **Next**.

7.  Configure the **Features and Permissions** you want to grant access to your cloud environment.

    :::warning[Important]

    - Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection is a pre-release feature and is not part of the existing features of an official commercial or general release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

    - If you want to use **Cloud Detections for Amazon Security Lake** to monitor your organization, you must configure an account within your organization to collect logs from other managed accounts. Connect your Security Lake account to Trend Vision One before connecting your organization account.

    - **Cloud Response for AWS** requires that you enable **Cloud Detections for AWS CloudTrail** monitoring for your AWS account, which you can do by:

      - Individual AWS account: Enable **Cloud Detections for AWS CloudTrail** in for the AWS account.

      - AWS Organization: Enable **Cloud Detections for AWS CloudTrail** and select the **AWS Control Tower deployment** checkox, or enable **Cloud Detections for Amazon Security Lake** with CloudTrail log monitoring enabled.

    - As of November 2023, AWS private and freemium accounts allow up to 10 Lambda executions. Container Protection deployment requires at least 20 concurrent Lambda executions. Please verify your AWS account status before enabling this feature.

    - Only the features and permissions listed here support deployment to organization managed accounts. If you want to enable additional features and permissions on an account, you must [connect the account individually](adding-aws-account.mdx) before connecting the organization account.
    :::

    - **Core Features**: Connect your AWS account to Trend Vision One to discover your cloud assets and rapidly identify risks such as compliance and security best practice violations in your cloud infrastructure.

    - **Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection**: Deploy Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection in your cloud account to scan for vulnerabilities and malware in supported cloud resources with zero impact to your applications.

      Click **Scanner Configuration** to choose the resource types to scan and whether to scan for vulnerabilities, malware, or both.

    - **Container Protection for Amazon ECS**: Deploy Trend Vision One Container Security in your AWS account to protect your containers and container images in Elastic Container Service (ECS) environments. Trend Vision One Container Security uncovers threats and vulnerabilities, protects your runtime environment, and enforces deployment policies.

    - **Cloud Response for AWS**: Allow Trend Vision One permission to take response actions to contain incidents within your cloud account, such as revoking access for suspicious IAM users. Additional response actions leverage integration with third party ticketing systems.

    - **Real-Time Posture Monitoring**: Deploy Real-Time Posture Monitoring in your AWS account to provide live monitoring with instant alerts for activities and events within your cloud environment.

    - **Cloud Detections for AWS VPC Flow Logs**: Deploy to collect your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) flow logs, enabling Trend Vision One to gather insight into your VPC traffic, with detection models to identify and provide alerts on malicious IP traffic, SSH brute force attacks, data exfiltration, and more. Review [VPC Flow Logs recommendations and requirements](vpc-flow-logs-requirements.mdx) before enabling the feature.

      Select the AWS regions you want to deploy the feature to.

      :::warning[Important]

      XDR for Cloud only supports monitoring VPC Flow Logs version 5 or later. For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs recommendations and requirements](vpc-flow-logs-requirements.mdx).
      :::

8.  Click **Next**.

9.  Launch the CloudFormation template in the AWS console.

    1.  If you want to review the stack template before launching, click **Download and Review Template**.

    2.  Click **Launch Stack**.

        The AWS management console opens in a new tab and displays the **Quick Create Stack** screen.

10. In the AWS management console, complete the steps in the **Quick Create Stack** screen.

    1.  If you want to use a name other than the default, specify a new **Stack name**.

    2.  In the **Parameters** section, specify the following parameters: *AWS Root ID* or the *Organizational Unit (OU) ID* in the **OrganizationID** field.

        - **OrganizationID**: type in the *AWS Root ID* or the *Organizational Unit (OU) ID* of the organization account.

          To add multiple Organization Units, type in the Organization Unit (OU) ID of each organization unit you want to add. Trend Vision One will deploy the stackset to each organization unit and associated child accounts.

        - (Optional) **OrganizationExcludedAccounts**: type in the account IDs of any AWS account within the organization you want to exclude from the monitoring features within the stack.

          Use this parameter field to exclude accounts you do not want monitored, or for accounts you want to use a different feature configuration. You can connect excluded accounts to the Cloud Accounts app individually. Type accounts as a list separated by a comma (,) with no spacing. For example, `123456789012,345678901234`

        :::warning[Important]

        The **OrganizationExcludedAccounts** parameter must only contain account IDs within the organization. Adding an account ID for an account that is not managed by the organization might cause the stack deployment to fail.

        Do not change any other settings in the **Parameters** section. CloudFormation automatically provides the settings for the parameters. Changing parameters might cause stack creation to fail.
        :::

    3.  In the **Capabilities** section, select the following acknowledgments:

        - **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.**

        - **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND**.

    4.  Click **Create Stack**.

        The **Stack details** screen for the new stack appears with the **Events** tab displayed. Creation might take a few minutes. Click **Refresh** to check the progress.

11. In the Trend Vision One console, click **Done**.

    The organization and associated member accounts appear in Cloud Accounts once the CloudFormation template deployment successfully completes. Refresh the screen to update the table.
