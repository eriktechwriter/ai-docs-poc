Device Control regulates access to external storage devices and network resources connected to computers. Device Control helps prevent data loss and leakage and, combined with file scanning, helps guard against security risks.

You can configure Device Control policies for internal and external agents. Administrators typically configure a stricter policy for external agents.

Trend Micro Apex Central provides both endpoint-based and user-based Device Control policy configuration.
