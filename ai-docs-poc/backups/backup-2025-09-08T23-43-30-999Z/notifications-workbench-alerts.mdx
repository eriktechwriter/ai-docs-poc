Send Trend Vision One notifications about new workbench alerts by configuring email, webhook, and mobile app account lists.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Administration â†’ Notifications**.

2.  Click **New Workbench alert** to open its settings panel.

    The toggle defaults to be opened on the panel.

3.  To send notifications to users by email, on the **Email** tab configure the **Recipients** list.

    1.  Specify email addresses or select from the list of Trend Vision One accounts.

        :::note

        Recently created Trend Vision One accounts may not immediately appear on the list.
        :::

    2.  Click **Send Test Message** to send a test notification. To send the test message only to emails you are adding to the recipient list, select **Send only to newly added recipients**. To send the test message to all recipients, select **Send to all recipients**.

        :::note

        You must wait a few minutes between sending test messages.
        :::

    3.  To send notifications to recipient groups based on Critical, High, Medium, or Low alert severity, enable **Notify recipients based on alert severity**. Click **Create Group**, configure the **Recipient Group Settings**, and then click **Save**.

        :::note

        The **Recipient** list must contain at least one recipient before you create a group.

        Recipients not assigned to groups automatically receive all notifications.
        :::

    4.  To send notifications that include detailed scope information, enable **Expanded impact scope details**.

    5.  To send notifications that include highlighted objects associated with the alert, enable **Include highlighted objects**. The notification only displays the first 10 highlighted objects, ordered by alert severity.

    6.  To prevent a large volume of low severity alert notifications, enable **Aggregate low severity alert notifications hourly**.

        For low severity alerts, notifications are aggregated hourly due to their high volume. For alerts of higher severity, an individual notification is sent for each alert as it is triggered.
