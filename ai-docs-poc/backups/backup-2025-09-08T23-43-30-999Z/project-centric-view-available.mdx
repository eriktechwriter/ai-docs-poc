April 8, 2025—You can now view your resources and risk events grouped by **Project** defined automatically in your Cloud Projects and adjusted manually through cloud platform accounts, cloud platform tags, and Trend Vision One tags. You can also define new Projects based on conditions based on Asset name, Asset type, Provider, Region, Location, Account Name, and Cloud Provider Asset Tags. For more information, see [Project Centric Overview](project-centric-overview.mdx).
