Invite all users in a group of your corporate identity provider (IdP) solution to sign in to the Trend Vision One console using their identities in the IdP solution.

A SAML Group Account is essentially a group synchronized from your identity provider that allows all group members to have single sign-on access to Trend Vision One.

You can add SAML groups in Trend Vision One for groups in the following identity providers:

- Microsoft Entra ID

- Active Directory (on-premises)
