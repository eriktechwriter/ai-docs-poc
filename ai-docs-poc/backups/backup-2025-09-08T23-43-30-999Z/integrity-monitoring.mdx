For a list of operating systems where Integrity Monitoring is supported, see [Supported features by platform](supported-features-linux-platform.mdx).
:::

The integrity monitoring module scans for unexpected changes to registry values, registry keys, services, processes, installed software, ports and files on agents. Using a baseline secure state as a reference, the integrity monitoring module performs scans on the above and logs an event (and an optional alert) if it detects any unexpected changes.

To enable and configure integrity monitoring, see [Set up integrity monitoring](set-up-integrity-monitoring.mdx).

For more information on creating integrity monitoring rules, see [Create an integrity monitoring rule](create-integrity-monitoring-rule.mdx). You can create a rule from a file or registry monitoring template, or by using the Server & Workload Protection XML-based [Integrity monitoring rules language](integrity-monitoring-language-swp.mdx).
