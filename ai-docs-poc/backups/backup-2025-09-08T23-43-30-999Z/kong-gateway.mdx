:::: {role="main"}
Configure the integration to allow Kong Gateway to send API endpoint information directly to the APIs page in Attack Surface Discovery. For more information, see [APIs](apis.mdx).

:::note

- The *Manage assets* permission in Attack Surface Discovery is required for integration with Kong Gateway. Trend Vision One will create an API key with the Operator role, which includes this permission. You can change this role to a more restrictive role if needed.

- The Trend Vision One Kong Gateway integration supports Kong Gateway OSS or Enterprise version 2.71 or later.

- To complete the configuration, you must contact your Trend Vision One account manager for access to the plugin and instructions for installing it.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, generate the API key to authenticate with Kong Gateway.

    1.  Go to **Third-Party Integration**.

    2.  Select **Kong Gateway**.

    3.  Click **Generate**.

    4.  From the **Expiration time** list, choose how long before the API key expires. The default value is one year.

    5.  Click **Add**.

    6.  Copy the API key value. This value will not be shown again. We recommended that you copy and paste this value in a text editor so you do not lose it.

    7.  Click **Close**.

2.  Copy the Endpoint URL from theTrend Vision One console. You will need this URL and the API key you just generated when configuring the plugin in Kong Gateway.

3.  Contact your Trend Vision One account team or send a request to alloftrend3rdpartyintegrations@trendmicro.com to access the plugin and configuration instructions.

Kong Gateway is added as a provider on the APIs screen in Attack Surface Discovery, where you can view details of the individual API endpoints contained in the collection.
