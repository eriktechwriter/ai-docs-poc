Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to `root:root`.

Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, the /etc/kubernetes/pki/ directory and all of the files and directories contained within it, are set to be owned by the root user.
