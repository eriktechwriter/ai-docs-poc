If you enable Time-of-Click Protection when creating a spam policy, Cloud Email Gateway Protection rewrites URLs in email messages for further analysis. Trend Micro analyzes those URLs at the time of click, and will block access to them or show a warning page (depending on your settings) if they are malicious.

You can choose to use the default blocking and warning pages or customize the blocking and warning pages according to your preference.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Inbound Protection → Spam Filtering → Time-of-Click Protection**.

2.  In the **Actions** section, do the following:

    - **Dangerous**: Select an action (**Allow**, **Warn** or **Block**) to take on dangerous URLs. The default value is **Block**.

      Dangerous URLs are verified to be fraudulent or known sources of threats.

    - **Highly Suspicious**: Select an action (**Allow**, **Warn** or **Block**) to take on highly suspicious URLs. The default value is **Block**.

      Highly suspicious URLs are suspected to be fraudulent or possible sources of threats.

    - **Suspicious**: Select an action (**Allow**, **Warn** or **Block**) to take on suspicious URLs. The default value is **Warn**.

      Suspicious URLs are associated with spam or possibly compromised.

    - **Untested**: Select an action (**Allow**, **Warn** or **Block**) to take on untested URLs. The default value is **Warn**.

      While Trend Micro actively tests URLs for safety, users may encounter untested pages when visiting new or less popular websites. Blocking access to untested pages can improve safety but can also prevent access to safe pages.

3.  In the **Blocking and Warning Pages** section, select whether to use the default blocking and warning pages or to customize your own ones.

    - **Use default redirect pages**: The default blocking page or warning page will appear when a malicious URL in the email message is clicked.

    - **Customize redirect pages**: Customize your own blocking page and warning page if you do not want to use the default ones.

      1.  Type a title for **Browser Tab Title**.

      2.  Click **Select File** to upload an image file from your local machine if you want to replace the default logo with your own company logo.

          The image file must be a PNG file that does not exceed 10 KB. The recommended image dimensions are 110 x 40 pixels.

          After the image file is successfully uploaded, you can preview the image in the **Content** area.

      3.  Next to **Content**, click the ![](/images/Edit_icon=GUID-626DE0A5-B8F1-4DEC-AB49-1099217003A9=1=en-us=Low.webp) icon next to the strings on the **Dangerous** tab and customize the strings.

          Repeat the customization settings on the **Highly Suspicious**, **Suspicious**, and **Untested** tabs in sequence.

          :::note

          When customizing the strings, you can use the following HTML tags for formatting: \<b\>, \<br\>, \<i\>, \<p\>, \<li\>, \<ol\>, \<ul\>, \<blockquote\>
          :::

      4.  Type the click-through link text.

          The click-through link text you customize apply to the warning pages for malicious URLs at each of the preceding risk levels.

          :::note

          The click-through link appears on the warning page only.
          :::

4.  Click **Save**.
