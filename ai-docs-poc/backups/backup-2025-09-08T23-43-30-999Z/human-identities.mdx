View details of user profiles in order to review type, status, and privilege information.

The **User** tab allows you to view details of all human user accounts in your organization. Human user accounts may be members or guests in your identity provider, and they may obtain access from either inside or outside of your organization. Some human user accounts may not have a configured user type. If you have sufficient permissions, you may configure a user type in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. For more information, see [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/users-search-enhanced).

The following table details the columns on the **User** tab.
