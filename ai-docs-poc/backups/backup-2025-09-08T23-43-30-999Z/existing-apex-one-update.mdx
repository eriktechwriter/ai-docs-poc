:::warning[Important]

- **Permanent update**: You cannot undo or stop the update once you begin. The update may take some time to complete depending on the number of agents managed by your Apex One as a Service instance. Trend Micro strongly recommends scheduling the update during off hours to avoid a disruption of service.

- **Forced sign out during update**: Communicate with any associates that access to your Trend Micro Apex One as a Service console will be immediately terminated once the update process begins. Finish all on-going tasks before starting the update. After the update completes, you may need to update your user accounts before re-accessing the system. If an account update is required, the affected users will receive an email notification with instructions about how to perform the update.

- **Post-update tasks**:

  - Verify that your user accounts have the correct access permissions and roles in the new User Account app and resolve any role conflicts.

  - Verify that all your endpoint groups, policies, and system settings updated properly to the Standard Endpoint Protection and Endpoint Inventory apps.

  - Check or establish your IdP connection in Trend Vision One.

  - The update process only moves your base agents and not your Endpoint Sensor agents. After the update process is complete, you must contact your support representative to re-associate your Endpoint Sensor agents with your Standard Endpoint Protection endpoints.

- **Compliance considerations**: Ensure that you have read and understood the [Privacy and personal data collection disclosure](ppdcd-trend-vision-one.mdx) for Trend Vision One. Customers that have PCI compliance concerns should contact a sales representative before starting the update.

- **Virtual desktops**: After updating to Trend Vision One, you must rebuild your golden image or Sysprep image if your endpoints meet all of the following criteria:

  - The virtual desktops managed under the Apex One Server that you update have never used the Trend Vision One Endpoint Sensor.

  - The virtual desktops are provisioned through a golden image for VDI or cloned as virtual machines using a Sysprep image.

  For more information, see [Creating a golden image with the agent software](create-golden-agent-image.mdx).
