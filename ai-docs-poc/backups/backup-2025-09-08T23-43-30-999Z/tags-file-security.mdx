Tags are a kind of metadata that you can associate with files or storage to identify, classify, organize, and manage these digital assets. Tags might indicate the purpose, department, project, status, priority, or source. File Security allows up to eight tags for each file or cloud container. Each tag can have up to 63 letters and numbers.

To get the most out of your tags, follow these best practices:

- Consider how you are using or plan to use tags throughout Trend Vision One.
- Define a system for naming and applying tags.
- Keep track of what tags are in use and what they refer to.
- Make tags easily recognizable and clearly distinct from others.
- Pay close attention to spelling, capitalization, and punctuation in tags.
- Regularly review and update outdated tags.
- Never use confidential, sensitive, or personally identifiable information (PII) in tags.
