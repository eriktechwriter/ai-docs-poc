This widget displays the unique compromised hosts logged by managed products within the last 30 days.

This widget groups and displays the unique compromised hosts as circles. The circle size relatively represents the number of compromised hosts.

- Small: 1 to 5

- Medium: 6 to 10

- Large: 11 or more

Mouse-over a computer icon or host name to display additional compromised hosts.

Use the **Callback address** drop-down to display compromised hosts that had callback attempts to the selected callback address.

:::note

The **Callback address** drop-down contains the top 25 callback addresses.

The widget only displays the first callback attempt from a compromised host to the selected callback address.

Change the managed products that the widget uses as its source by clicking the settings icon ( **â†’** ).
