Use the Trend Micro Apex One server console to easily move agents to Trend Vision One Standard Endpoint Protection.

Follow the instructions below to connect your Trend Micro Apex One as a Service or Trend Micro Apex Central on-premises products to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security and move selected endpoints from your Trend Micro Apex One server to Standard Endpoint Protection.

:::note

- After moving agents to Standard Endpoint Protection, you cannot move them back to Trend Micro Apex One as a Service or Trend Micro Apex Central using the Trend Vision One console. If you need to move agents from Trend Vision One, you must use the IPXfer tool.

- Agents inherit the settings of the target server.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To copy your current endpoint policies, export Trend Micro Apex One security agent policies to Standard Endpoint Protection.

    1.  On the Trend Micro Apex Central web console, go to **Policies → Policy Management**.

    2.  Select the type of product settings from the **Product** list.

    3.  Select one or more policies and click **Export Settings** and save the file.

        - If you exported a single policy, the resulting file has the extension `*.CMPOLICY`.

        - If you exported several policies, the resulting file is a compressed (`.ZIP`) file containing the individual `.CMPOLICY` files.

    4.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Endpoint Security → Standard Endpoint Protection**.

        If you have more than one Standard Endpoint Protection instance, select the instance you want to use for the evaluation.

    5.  In the target instance, go to **Policies → Policy Management**

    6.  Click **Import Settings** and locate the policy file to import.

        - You can import a .ZIP file containng several policy files, or import individual .CMPOLICY files.

        - If the selected policy already exists, a confirmation prompt appears, asking if you want to overwrite the existing policy.

          Click **OK** to continue.

2.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Endpoint Security → Standard Endpoint Protection**.

    If you have more than one Standard Endpoint Protection instance, select the instance you want to use for the evaluation.

3.  In the target instance, go to **Directories → Product Servers**

4.  Copy the FQDN of the server you want to use.

    Only include the address of the FQDN. Do not include the port or path.

    For example, if the target server is `https://exampl.manage.trendmicro.com:443/officescan`, copy `exampl.manage.trendmicro.com`.

5.  On the Trend Micro Apex Central web console, go to **Directories → Product Servers**.

6.  Locate the Trend Micro Apex One server from where you want to move agents, and click the server access link to single sign-on to the server console.

    The Trend Micro Apex One server console opens in a new browser tab or window.

7.  On the Trend Micro Apex One server console, go to **Agents → Agent Management**.

8.  Select the agents you want to move.

    You can use SHIFT+Click or CTRL+Click to select multiple agents.

9.  Click **Manage Agent Tree → Move Agent**.

10. Select **Move selected agent(s) to another Apex One server**.

11. Paste the target server FQDN for the **Apex One Server name or IP address**.

12. Click **Move**.

    Once the selected agents complete moving, the agents begin reporting to the Trend Vision One Standard Endpoint Protection instance.
