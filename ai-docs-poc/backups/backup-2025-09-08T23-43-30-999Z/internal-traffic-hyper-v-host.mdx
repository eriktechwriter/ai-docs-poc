Configure internal network traffic to allow Virtual Network Sensor to monitor data.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the host machine, access the Hyper-V Manager.

2.  Set the Virtual Network Sensor as the traffic mirror target.

    1.  Right-click the Virtual Network Sensor virtual machine, and select **Settings...**

    2.  In the settings window, use the navigation bar to go to **Network Adapter (Data Switch) → Advanced Features**.

    3.  Under the **Port mirroring** section, set **Mirroring mode** to **Destination**.

    4.  Click **Apply**, then click **OK**.

3.  Locate the virtual machine you want to monitor and set it as the traffic mirror source.

    1.  Right-click the source virtual machine, and select **Settings...**

    2.  In the settings window, use the navigation bar to go to **Network Adapter (Data Switch) → Advanced Features**.

    3.  Under the **Port mirroring** section, set **Mirroring mode** to **Source**.

    4.  Click **Apply**, then click **OK**.

    Repeat step 3 for any additional virtual machines you want to monitor with the Virtual Network Sensor.

    After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command `show traffic` to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic.
