Leveraging AI-powered threat detection and global threat intelligence, the platform enables earlier detection, faster response, and reduced risk for organizations of all sizes.

Highlights:

- Centralized cyber risk exposure management: Continuous attack surface discovery, asset risk assessment, and automated risk mitigation.

- Integrated security operations: Extended Detection and Response (XDR), Cyber Risk Exposure Management (CREM), and automation/orchestration of threat response workflows.

- Robust layered protection: Comprehensive coverage for hybrid IT environments with seamless third-party integrations and expert managed services.
