Get an overview of your AI-related cloud asset security posture in AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) using interactive widgets and table views.

:::warning[Important]

- This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.
:::

Using cloud services to create AI applications that expand your organization's capabilities necessarily expands your attack surface. AI-SPM gives you visibility into the cloud assets your organization uses to build AI services, including threats, misconfigurations, and potential attack paths.

The **AI-SPM** tab in **Cloud Security Posture** displays interactive widgets summarizing key information about the AI-related assets in your connected cloud accounts. The summary overview displays a breakdown of your AI assets in the following categories:

- Cloud services

- Workloads

- Models

- Data storage

- Entitlements

Clicking on an asset type displays risk events and at-risk assets within the asset type. Clicking **View High Risk**displays a list of all high-risk AI assets in **Attack Surface Discovery** from the last 30 days, where you can view detailed asset profile information.

The following additional widgets display specific information about your AI assets.

<tr>
<td><p>Threat Alerts</p></td>
<td><p>Displays the total number of threat alerts related to your AI assets as well as the total over the last 24 hours. The graph displays the threat alert trend over the last 30 days.</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>Potential Attack Paths</p></td>
<td><p>Displays the total number of detected potential attack paths through your AI assets as well as the total over the last 24 hours. The graph displays the attack path detection trend over the last 30 days.</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>AI Cloud Assets Breakdown</p></td>
<td><p>Displays an overview of all connected cloud accounts containing AI assets, along with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Account name</p></li>
<li><p>Cloud provider</p></li>
<li><p>Overall risk score for the account</p></li>
<li><p>Detected vulnerabilities</p></li>
<li><p>Total detected threats and alerts</p></li>
<li><p>Total detected misconfigurations</p></li>
<li><p>Total AI assets in the account</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Search accounts by account name or ID, or filter by cloud provider.</p>
<p>Select an account to display information in the AI-SPM tab for the specified account only. Displaying information for a single account causes the <strong>AI Risk Events</strong> table to show only risk events for the specified account. <strong>AI Cloud Assets Breakdown</strong> instead displays the AI assets at risk for the specified cloud account.</p></td>
