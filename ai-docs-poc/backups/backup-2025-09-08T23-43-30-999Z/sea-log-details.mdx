Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides detailed information for email messages detected as possible social engineering attacks. To view social engineering attack details, click the **Details** link beside **Social engineering attack** on the **Mail Tracking Details** screen.

The following table lists the possible reasons for social engineering attack detections.
