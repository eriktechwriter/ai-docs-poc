Run a cross-layer attack simulation in Trend Vision One to simulate attacks targeting multiple security layers across your environment.

The cross-layer attack simulation requires that you prepare one deployed [Virtual Network Sensor](network-sensors-deploy-guides.mdx) or connected [Deep Discovery Inspector appliance](ddi-connection-deployment.mdx), and [two Windows endpoints with Endpoint Sensor enabled](simulations-endpoint-sensor.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the Trend Vision One console, click the **Resource Center** icon (![](/images/resourceCenter=73b1d431-813b-467c-8098-62f12bb6e2af.webp)).

2.  Click **Simulations**.

3.  Click **Cross-layer attack simulation**.

    The **Cross-layer attack simulation** window appears.

4.  Click **Download demo script** to download the demo script.

5.  Run the script on one of the Windows endpoints.

    :::note

    Ensure that you specify the IP address of both endpoints while running the script.
    :::

6.  On the **Cross-layer attack simulation** screen, click **Download demo script** in the **Endpoint** section to download the second demo script.

7.  On a Windows endpoint with Endpoint Sensor enabled, run the second demo script.

8.  Go to **Agentic SIEM & XDR → Workbench** or **Agentic SIEM & XDR → Observed Attack Techniques** to view the results.

    :::note

    Results might take a few minutes to appear.
