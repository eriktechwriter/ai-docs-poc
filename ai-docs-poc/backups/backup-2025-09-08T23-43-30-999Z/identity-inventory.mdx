Get instant visibility into human and non-human identities plus entitlements across your organization to manage identities and enhance your security framework.

**Identity Inventory** provides a centralized location to view information about the identities, both human and non-human, and the entitlements used across your organization. Trend Vision One leverages your connected identity providers (IdP), such as Microsoft Entra ID, to allow you to review and monitor user and group privileges and access policies. The increased visibility helps you quickly identify policy misconfigurations and overprivileged identities and strengthen your security posture.

To enable all of the features available in **Identity Inventory**, you must grant specific read and write permissions from your connected identity provider. To learn more, see [Get started with Identity Inventory](getting-started-identity-inventory.mdx).

The Identity Inventory is organized by identity provider. Click an identity provider under **DATA SOURCES** to view more detailed information about identities.
