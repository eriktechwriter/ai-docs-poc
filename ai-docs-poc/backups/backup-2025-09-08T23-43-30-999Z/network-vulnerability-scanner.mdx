:::::: {role="main"}
Conduct agentless scanning of your network for fast visibility into your organization's network infrastructure and vulnerabilities.

:::warning[Important]

This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.
:::

Network Vulnerability Scanner allows you to systematically discover network assets, identify potential security weaknesses in network devices, and detect misconfigurations in your internet-facing assets to safeguard against cyber threats and ensure the integrity of your organizationâ€™s infrastructure. No agent deployment is required. You can create individual scan configurations based on templates and set the scans to run on a predetermined schedule or trigger scans manually.

Network Vulnerability Scanner requires an up-to-date Service Gateway virtual appliance with version 1.1.0 or later of the Network Vulnerability Scanner service installed. When configuring a new scan in **Scan Templates** or by clicking **Create scan** in **Network scans**, you may choose the Service Gateway to use for the specified scan. Only Service Gateways with the Network Vulnerability Scanner service installed are able to run scans. A single Service Gateway can run up to a maximum of 15 concurrent scans.

:::tip

To request more templates, click **Need more templates?** in **Scan templates** and provide your feedback.
:::

After a scan completes, you can download the scan report from the **Scan Reports** tab to view discovered devices and detected vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Discovered devices appear in **Attack Surface Discovery**. Detected vulnerabilities and system configuration events appear in **Threat and Exposure Management** and **Cyber Risk Overview**.

:::warning[Important]

For all scan templates, Network Vulnerability Scanner only uses a single IP address to scan and report results for any supplied FQDN that resolves to multiple IP addresses.
