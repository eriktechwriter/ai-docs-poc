Policy management allows administrators to enforce product settings on managed products and endpoints from a single management console. Administrators create a policy by selecting the targets and configuring a list of product settings.

To perform policy management on a new managed product or endpoint, move the managed product from the **New Entity** folder to another folder in the Product Directory structure.
