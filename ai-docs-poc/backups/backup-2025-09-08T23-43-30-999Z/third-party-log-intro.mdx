Collect, organize, manage, and store third-party log data in Trend Vision One log repositories using collectors connected to a deployed Service Gateway.

Third-Party Log Collection is a log management system that allows you to ingest and retain log data from your organization's third-party data sources. Ingested data gives you actionable data visibility for threat detection and correlation in Agentic SIEM plus support for compliance audits and regulatory data management. Set specific ingestion and retention types for each log repository to more efficiently organize collected log data and access the data when needed in Trend Vision One solutions.

Third-Party Log Collection manages log data using a hierarchical system consisting of:

- [Log repositories](log-repositories.mdx): Ingest and store third-party log data according to specified ingestion and retention types and time periods

- [Collectors](collectors.mdx): Receive log data from configured third-party data sources and forward the data to specific log repositories

- [Service Gateway virtual appliances](service-gateway-management.mdx): Install the Third-Party Log Collection service on your deployed Service Gateways to facilitate log collection from your third-party data sources

To set up a log repository to ingest and store third-party log data:

1.  If you do not already have a deployed Service Gateway that meets the minimum requirements for the Third-Party Log Collection service, [deploy a Service Gateway virtual appliance](deployment-guides.mdx). The Service Gateway must have at least 1 CPU and 128 MB of virtual memory available.

2.  [Install the Third-Party Log Collection service](install-tplc-service.mdx) on your Service Gateway.

3.  If using the TLS protocol to receive third-party data logs from a data source, [upload a certificate](dslm-faqs.mdx) to your Service Gateway for validation purposes.

4.  [Create a log repository](create-log-repository.mdx) in Third-Party Log Collection with the desired ingestion and retention settings.

5.  [Add one or more collectors](create-collector.mdx) to the log repository configured to receive data from your third-party data sources.

6.  Configure your third-party data source to export log data to [collectors](collectors.mdx).

7.  Execute queries on ingested log data in [XDR Data Explorer](search-app.mdx) and monitor log repository traffic usage in [Service Gateway Management](service-gateway-management.mdx).

Collectors receive and forward all valid logs from the specified third-party log data sources.
