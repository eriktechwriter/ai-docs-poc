    1.  Select **Enable** to put the policy rule into effect, or clear this option to disable it.

    2.  Name the policy rule.

        :::note

        Trend Micro recommends using a descriptive name that will allow administrators to easily identify this policy rule from the rule list. For instance, if you are creating a spam policy rule that applies to the `one.example.com` domain, you might name it something like "One Example Spam Rule".
