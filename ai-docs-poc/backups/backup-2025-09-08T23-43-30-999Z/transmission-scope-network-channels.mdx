Transmission scope and targets define data transmissions on network channels that Data Loss Prevention must monitor. For transmissions that should be monitored, Data Loss Prevention checks for the presence of data identifiers before allowing or blocking the transmission. For transmissions that should not be monitored, Data Loss Prevention does not check for the presence of data identifiers and immediately allows the transmission.
