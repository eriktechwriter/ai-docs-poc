Connect your Trend Micro Apex One servers to Trend Vision One.

Trend Vision One does not support a direct connection to an on-premises Trend Micro Apex One server. You can connect your Trend Micro Apex One servers to Trend Vision One by first connecting to a Trend Micro Apex Central management server, then integrating your Apex Central server with Trend Vision One.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Register your on-premises Apex Central server to Trend Micro Apex One.

    For more details, see [Trend Micro Apex One documentation](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/apex-one-service-pack-1-patch-3-server-online-help-osce-registering-pro).

    1.  On the Trend Micro Apex One web-based management console, go to **Administration → Settings → Apex Central**.

    2.  Specify a display name for the Apex Central server in the Trend Micro Apex One console.

        If you do not specify a display name, the name defaults to the host name of the server computer and the product name.

    3.  Specify the Apex Central server FQDN or IP address and the port number to use to connect to this server.

        - For a dual-stack Trend Micro Apex One server, type the Apex Central FQDN or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6, if available).
        - For a pure IPv4 Trend Micro Apex One server, type the Apex Central FQDN or IPv4 address.
        - For a pure IPv6 Trend Micro Apex One server, type the Apex Central FQDN or IPv6 address.

    4.  In the **Apex Central certificate** section, click **Browse...** and upload the certificate file downloaded from the Apex Central server.

        :::note

        To obtain the Apex Central certificate file, go to the Apex Central server and copy the certificate file to theTrend Micro Apex One server from the following location: `<Apex Central installation folder>\Certificate\CA\TMCM_CA_Cert.pem`
        :::

    5.  To authenticate the Apex Central IIS web server, type the user name and password.

    6.  To use a proxy server to connect to the Apex Central server, specify the following proxy settings:

        - Proxy protocol
        - Server FQDN or IPv4/IPv6 address and port
        - Proxy server authentication user ID and password

    7.  Depending on whether you want to use one-way communication or two-way communication port forwarding, specify the IPv4/IPv6 address and port.

    8.  To test whether the Apex Central server can connect to Trend Micro Apex One, click **Test Connection**.

    9.  Click **Register**.

2.  Generate an enrollment token in Trend Vision One.

    1.  Sign in to the Trend Vision One console.

    2.  Go to **Service Management → Product Instance**.

    3.  Click **Add Existing Product**.

    4.  In the **Instance type** field, select **Trend Micro Apex Central On-Premises**.

    5.  Click the link to generate an enrollment token, and copy the new token.

    6.  Click **Save**.

3.  Integrate Apex Central with Trend Vision One.

    For more details, see [Apex Central documentation](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/apex-central-patch-8-online-help-v1integration).

    1.  On the Apex Central console, go to **Trend Vision One → Integration Settings**.

    2.  Paste in the enrollment token obtained from the Trend Vision One console.

    3.  Under **Settings**, enable the following settings:

        - Forward detection logs and endpoint information to Trend Vision One

        - Synchronize suspicious object lists from Trend Vision One

    4.  Click **Register**.

        Your Apex Central management server connects to Trend Vision One.
