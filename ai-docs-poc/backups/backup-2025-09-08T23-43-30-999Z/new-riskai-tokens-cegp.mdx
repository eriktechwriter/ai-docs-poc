February 18, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection now includes two new tokens - %CI_RULE_NAME% and %CI_RULE_DESC%, that administrators can use in email notifications for policy matches and in stamps inserted into the message body. These tokens help identify which security risks or anomalies have been detected by Correlated Intelligence, providing clearer and more detailed information in your email security alerts.
