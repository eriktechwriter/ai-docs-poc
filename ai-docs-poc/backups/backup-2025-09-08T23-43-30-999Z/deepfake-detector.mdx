Learn about advanced AI deepfake detection available in Mobile Security policies to detect synthesized images during video calls on end user devices.

Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to create highly realistic images, videos, or audio that are difficult to distinguish from authentic media. The synthetic creations can mimic the appearance and voices of real people, posing significant risks. Mobile Security uses advanced AI detection algorithms to identify potential deepfakes during end user video calls.

Deepfake Detection identifies characteristics such as unnatural blinking patterns, unusual facial symmetry, and inconsistencies in audio-visual synchronization. By leveraging these indicators, Mobile Security can effectively flag potential deepfake technology use on managed end user devices.

Issues posed by deepfakes include:

- Potential information theft and fraud: Use of impersonations for fraudulent activities, such as unauthorized account access or impersonation of individuals with higher ranks in the organization

- Privacy violations: Manipulation of personal images and videos without consent or misrepresentation of people within the organization

- Misinformation: Risk of organizational accounts spreading harmful and false content

Mobile Security uses deep learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and facial recognition to protect end users from AI-generated media during live video calls. Enabling the feature ensures end users are interacting with genuine persons, safeguarding users against potential scams and misinformation and protecting your organization against security breaches.

To enable Deepfake Detector on your end user devices:

1.  Create a new Mobile Security Policy for iOS/iPadOS devices managed by Mobile Device director, or create a Mobile Policy for devices managed by another MDM solution.

    :::warning[Important]

    - Deepfake Detector is currently only available for devices running iOS 14 and later.

    - Devices must have 4GB of available memory.
    :::

2.  Assign the policy to one or more assignment groups and click **Save**.

3.  Instruct your end users on how to use the new feature.

    1.  While on a video call, open the Mobile Security app and tap **Start detection**.

    2.  Select **Trend Micro Mobile Security** and tap **Start Broadcast**.

    3.  Return to the video call.

    4.  To stop detection, slide the red icon at the top of the screen and tap **Stop**.

4.  Tell end users they may also start detection from the iPhone Control Center.

    1.  While on a video call, open the iPhone Control Center.

    2.  Touch and hold the record button until options appear.

    3.  Select **Trend Micro Mobile Security** and tap **Start Broadcast**.

    4.  To stop detection, slide the red icon at the top of the screen and tap **Stop**.

Deepfake Detector automatically stops recording after 3 minutes. If anomalies are found, the end user receives a set of next steps, and the detection is logged in **Mobile Detection Logs**.
