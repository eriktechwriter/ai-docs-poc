Information regarding traffic mirroring with physical switches and network devices.

You can use a physical network switch and other network devices to set up traffic mirroring between the monitored port and the Virtual Network Sensor data port. Follow the guidance provided by your device manufacturer to configure your network settings.

After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command `show traffic` to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic. For more information about troubleshooting, see [Virtual Network Sensor FAQ](virtual-network-sensor-faqs.mdx) and [Virtual Network Sensor CLI commands](virtual-network-sensor-cli-commands.mdx).

The following is a list of links to the help documentation for several popular network device manufacturers. These links open pages on websites not owned by Trend Micro.
