July 4, 2023—You can now specify custom detection models when configuring Target nodes for Automated Response Playbooks. Subsequent nodes in the playbook are only triggered for Workbench alerts related to the specified detection models.

Enhancements to the Security Playbooks user interface facilitate selecting and enabling detection models.

For more information, see [Create Automated Response Playbooks](create-automated-response-playbooks.mdx).
