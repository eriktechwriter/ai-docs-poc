The default owner of a policy is the user account that created the policy. You can use the **Policy Management** screen to change the owner of a policy to any Trend Vision One user account. You can also change the policy owner to an Active Directory group, which designates all Active Directory users within the group as owners of the policy.

:::warning[Important]

If you change the owner of a policy to a user account that does not have access rights to the specified targets, the new owner can modify the policy settings but cannot view the policy data.
