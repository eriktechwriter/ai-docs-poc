November 29—To streamline your risk reduction workflows, in Case Management you can now assign priority and ownership to cases containing risk events from Threat and Exposure Management. When you open a case in Threat and Exposure Management, you can choose which third-party ticketing system, webhook channel, or email address to notify.
