If the agent has network connectivity to Server & Workload Protection, the agents activate and provide protection to your workloads.

However, Server & Workload Protection does not comply with user and data transmission restrictions as specified by United States of America International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

You must ensure all compliance and regulatory requirements are met for your deployment.
