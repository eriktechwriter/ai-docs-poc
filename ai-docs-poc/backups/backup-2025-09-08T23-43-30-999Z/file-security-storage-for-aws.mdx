File Security Storage provides easy deployment using AWS CloudFormation to integrate automated scanning of files as you upload them into your storage and effortlessly detect all types of malware including viruses, trojans, spyware, and more.

You deploy File Security Storage using the AWS CloudFormation template. After deploying the File Security Storage scanner stack to the selected region and turning on EventBridge for selected buckets in that region, the scanner stack scans all incoming files. The Scanner stack is located in each region, with one server in each region and bucket. When event notification turned on, the scanner Lambda scans any incoming file in the scanner stack. In the CloudFormation template, you can set parameters to send malicious files to a quarantine bucket and clean files to a promote bucket.

The scanner Lambda then sends malicious files to quarantine.
