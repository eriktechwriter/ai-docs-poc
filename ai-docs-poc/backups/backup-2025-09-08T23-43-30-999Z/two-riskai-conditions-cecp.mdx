February 21, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection adds two more conditions for defining custom detection signals for anomalies in Correlated Intelligence. These conditions define the number of days within a 30-day period that communication from a sender or sender's domain is considered abnormal on a company-wide basis.

These conditions are not available in all regions.
