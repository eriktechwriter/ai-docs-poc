The [Real-Time Posture Monitoring (RTPM)](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity-real-time-threat-monitoring) settings allow you to install, update and delete the required resources for RTPM. Once you create the required resources, events from the cloud account appear on the RTPM event monitoring dashboard, and a [subset of Rules](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity-rules) start to update based on these events. We provide both Powershell and Bash scripts to set up RTPM.

:::note

- For AWS Accounts: Real-Time Posture Montoring can be enabled through Account Management in Trend Vision One.
- For Azure and Google Cloud Accounts: You can enable the feature by running the executable scripts mentioned in the sections below.
