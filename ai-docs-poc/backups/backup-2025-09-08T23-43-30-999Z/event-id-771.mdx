Event ID 771 *Contact by Unrecognized Client* appears in Server & Workload Protection if an agent tries to connect to Server & Workload Protection but the computer's name doesn't exist in the list of protected computers on *Computers*.

Common causes include:

- Cloned VMs or cloud instances if you haven't enabled *Reactivate cloned Agents*.
- Computers deleted from *Computers* before deactivating the agent, if you haven't enabled *Reactivate unknown Agents*. The agent software continues to try to periodically connect to Server & Workload Protection, causing the event each time until either it is uninstalled, or you reactivate the computer.
- Interrupted sync of a connector such as AWS or Azure.

Solutions vary by the cause.

### Uninstall the agent {#uninstall-the-agent}

If you don't want to protect the unrecognized computer, you can prevent these events by deactivating or uninstalling the agent software. See [Uninstall the Server & Workload Protection Agent](uninstall-swp-agent.mdx).

### Reactivate the computer or clone {#reactivate-the-computer-or-clone}

If you want to protect the computer, activate it with Server & Workload Protection. Re-activation re-establishes the agent's certificate so that Server & Workload Protection can authenticate it with the list on *Computers*, and recognize the computer. See [Agent-Initiated Activation](agent-settings.mdx).
