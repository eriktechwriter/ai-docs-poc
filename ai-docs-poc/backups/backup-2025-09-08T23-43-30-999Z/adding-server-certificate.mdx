Upload a server certificate for your organization's internal applications to facilitate browser access.

For the servers that host your organization's internal applications, you can use the default self-signed certificate provided by Trend Vision One or upload your own server certificate. Complete the following steps to upload a server certificate.

:::note

If you use the default certificate, the web browser displays a web server certificate error when users launch the app because the hostname of the app and the certificate do not match.
