The Cloud Accounts Breakdown widget presents a list of cloud accounts, sorted by their overall risk score in descending order. From this widget, you can:

- **Filter by Cloud Provider**: Narrow down the list by selecting a specific cloud provider.
- **Explore Account Details**: Click a cloud account name to view its associated assets. From there, click any asset name to see detailed information in the Attack Surface Discovery page and take necessary remediation steps.
