Learn how to enable Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection in your AWS account and understand provider-specific feature requirements and limitations.

To start scanning for vulnerabilities and malware in your cloud resources, add your AWS account to Trend Vision One in [Cloud Accounts](cloud-accounts.mdx) using the CloudFormation template. Enable Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection, and then click **Scanner Settings** to choose the resource types to scan and whether to scan for vulnerabilities, malware, or both. Vulnerability scanning is enabled for all supported resources by default. Anti-malware scanning is disabled by default. You can change the scanning configuration at any time. For detailed instructions, see [Adding an AWS account using CloudFormation](adding-aws-account.mdx).

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection scans the following AWS resource types:

- EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances

- ECR images that have the "latest" tag

- Lambda functions and attached Lambda layers

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection works in AWS by taking a snapshot of EBS volumes and collecting ECR images, Lambda function zip archives, and Lambda layers. The collected resources are then scanned for vulnerabilities or malware. Lambda functions deployed with container images are covered by ECR image scanning.

:::warning[Important]

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection takes snapshots of your EBS volumes prior to scanning and tags the snapshots with the tag `trend-micro-product:avtd`. Use the tag to identify snapshots waiting to be scanned and to exclude the snapshots from any automated deletion processes you have configured. Snapshots are automatically deleted from your AWS account after the scan completes.

</figure>

Scan results are sent to Trend Vision One and can be seen in **Cloud Risk Management**, **Cyber Risk Overview**, **Threat and Exposure Management**, and asset profile screens in **Attack Surface Discovery**. After you patch vulnerabilities or remediate malware in EBS volumes, Lambda functions, or Lambda layers, the detections no longer appear after the next daily scan. Vulnerability detections in ECR images remain visible in **Threat and Exposure Management → Vulnerabilities** for seven days after patching. Malware detections in ECR images remain visible in **Threat and Exposure Management → All Risk Events** for seven days after remediation.

The following table lists scanning limitations that apply to each supported AWS resource type.
