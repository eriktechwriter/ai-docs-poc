Before migrating data from IMSS 9.1 or IMSVA 9.1, make sure the following has been done:

- Add, provision, and verify the domains you want to manage through Cloud Email Gateway Protection.

  For details, see [Adding a domain](adding-domain.mdx).

- Synchronize with LDAP servers using the Directory Synchronization Tool if IMSS or IMSVA has enabled LDAP settings.

  The Directory Synchronization Tool is available under **Administration → Other Settings → Directory Management**.

  For details, refer to [Directory Synchronization Tool User's Guide](https://docs.trendmicro.com/all/ent/tmems/vAll/en-us/Directory%20Synchronization%20Tool%20Users%20Guide.pdf).

- Enable IMSS or IMSVA to support Cloud Email Gateway Protection migration by doing the following:

  1.  On the IMSS or IMSVA management console, go to **Administration → Updates → System & Applications** and check the build number.

      If the build number does not meet the following requirements, install the latest service pack and hotfix.

      - IMSS 9.1.0.1357 or later
      - IMSVA 9.1.0.2011 or later

  2.  Enable the hidden key in the IMSS or IMSVA admin database by running the following SQL statements:

      :::note

      IMSS and IMSVA use the same configuration file `imss.ini`.
      :::

      `insert into tb_global_setting (section, name, value, inifile)`

      `values ('imp_exp', 'enable_ems_migrate', '1', 'imss.ini');`

- Export configuration files from the IMSS or IMSVA management console under **Administration → Import/Export**.
