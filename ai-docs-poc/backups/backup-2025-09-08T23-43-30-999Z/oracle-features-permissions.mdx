Connecting your Oracle compartment account allows various Trend Vision One apps and security features to access your cloud assets and gain greater visibility over assets and monitor for potential threats. The core features deployed when connecting enable the following Trend Vision One apps and features to monitor your cloud environment:

- **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery → Cloud Assets**

  For more information, see [Cloud assets](cloud-assets.mdx).

- **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery → APIs**

  For more information, see [APIs](apis.mdx).

- **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Cloud Security Posture**

  For more information, see [Cloud Security Posture](cloud-posture.mdx).

:::note

Your Oracle assets appear in the Endpoint Inventory list. Assets without the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent installed appear as [unmanaged endpoints](endpoint-list-faq.mdx).
