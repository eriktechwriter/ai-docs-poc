View information about the **Vulnerabilities** risk factor, which is determined by CVEs detected on your managed assets.

Trend Micro uses global activity data, CVE information, and local detection activity to analyze your environment and produce customized vulnerability assessment scores for each asset. The Vulnerabilities risk factor contributes to your [exposure level](exposure-overview.mdx).

Trend Micro sources CVE information from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and security advisories issued by major software vendors, such as Microsoft and Red Hat. The NVD sometimes publishes information later than the vendors of affected products, which might result in delayed CVE assessment results in Trend Vision One.

The Vulnerability Assessment service scans endpoints for vulnerabilities related to operating systems, applications, ECR container images, cloud VMs, and serverless functions. For more information about the specific operating systems supported by Vulnerability Assessment, see [Vulnerability Assessment supported operating systems](vulnerability-assessment-os.mdx). For more information about supported language packages used in ECR container images, see [Vulnerability Assessment supported language packages](vulnerability-assess-languages.mdx).

On Windows devices, Vulnerability Assessment updates between 10 minutes and 1 hour after an operating system vulnerability is patched. Applications are scanned every ten minutes. On macOS and Linux devices, Vulnerability Assessment scans for vulnerabilities once per day.

:::warning[Important]

To start receiving vulnerability data in Trend Vision One, you must first connect one or more vulnerabilities data sources. For more information, see [Vulnerability Assessment](vulnerability-assessment.mdx).

<p>The tabs of the <strong>Detected Vulnerabilities</strong> widget display CVEs detected on your internal and internet-facing assets, containers, cloud VMs, and serverless functions. Mitigating the vulnerabilities with the highest CVE impact scores, global exploit activity, or CVSS scores is an effective way to reduce the Cyber Risk Index.</p>

<li><p>Dismissed: The vulnerability is not applicable to associated assets or your environment.
