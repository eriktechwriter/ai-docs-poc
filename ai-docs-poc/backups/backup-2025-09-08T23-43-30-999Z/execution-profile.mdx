View objects and events using a dynamic and interactive visualization.

:::note

Before using the execution profile, [make sure WebGL is configured in your web browser](enabling-webgl.mdx).
:::

The Execution Profile offers a visualization of objects and events using a dynamic and interactive chain view instead of static analysis results. You can adjust the view by expanding or collapsing the chain to focus on the objects and events you want to investigate.

Click **Save Progress** to save the current view. Saved Execution Profiles generated directly from **Observed Attack Techniques** or the **XDR Data Explorer** app are only accessible using the provided URL.

The following table describes the elements that comprise the Execution Profile.
