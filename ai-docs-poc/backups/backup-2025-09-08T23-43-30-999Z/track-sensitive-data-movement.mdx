With Data Security you can investigate the transmission of sensitive data in your monitored network locations. When you create a data policy, Trend Vision One forwards Data Detection and Response information to Agentic SIEM & XDR, where you can:

- View and investigate related alerts in Workbench

- View sensitive data events in Observed Attack Techniques

- Search for sensitive data events in **XDR Data Explorer**

- Open a graph view called Data Lineage that depicts the movement of sensitive data in your environment. You can access Data Lineage from both Workbench and Observed Attack Techniques.

:::note

To access Data Lineage, you must enable Data Security and then do the following:

- Create a data policy to specify the network locations you want to monitor for sensitive data. For more information, see [Data Policy](data-policy-overview.mdx)

- Configure an endpoint security policy with the **Endpoint sensor detection and response** and **Data Detection Response** settings enabled. For more information, see [Configure endpoint security policies](configuring-endpoint-policies.mdx).

  For more information about Data Security, see [Data Security](data-security-overview.mdx).
