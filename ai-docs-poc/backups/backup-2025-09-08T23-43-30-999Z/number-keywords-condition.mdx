Each keyword list contains a condition that requires a certain number of keywords be present in a document before the list triggers a violation.

The number of keywords condition contains the following values:

- *All*: All of the keywords in the list must be present in the document.

- *Any*: Any one of the keywords in the list must be present in the document.

- *Specific number*: There must be at least the specified number of keywords in the document. If there are more keywords in the document than the number specified, Data Loss Prevention triggers a violation.
