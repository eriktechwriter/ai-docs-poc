August 4, 2025—Cyber Risk Exposure Management displays high and medium impact CVEs (CVEs with an impact score of 31 to 100) in your internal assets by default. However, visibility into low-impact CVEs (CVEs with an impact score range of 0-30) may also be necessary for your organization to meet compliance requirements or follow internal policies. You can now configure your level of CVE coverage in Threat and Exposure Management. To learn more, see [CVE assessment visibility and configuration](full-cve-assessment.mdx).
