::: {role="main"}
February 14, 2024—**Cloud Risk Management** no longer supports the following compliance standards:

- CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0

- CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.3.0

- CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0

- CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v1.1.0

- CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v1.2.0

These five standards are no longer accessible in filters, which prevents the creation of new reports and report configurations. You can no longer generate new PDF or CSV reports using existing report configurations that include any of the five standards. However, any PDF or CSV reports generated before support was ended remain available.

Please update your report configurations to use the latest versions of CIS Benchmarks.
