With Email Continuity, Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides a standby email system that gives virtually uninterrupted use of email in the event of a mail server outage. If a planned or unplanned outage occurs, Cloud Email Gateway Protection will keep your incoming email messages for 10 days. Once your email server is back online within the 10-day period, these messages will be restored to your email server.

A continuity mailbox is available instantly and automatically, providing end users the ability to read, forward, download and reply to any email messages. This enables end users to have continued email access during an outage without requiring any action from IT.

In fact, Cloud Email Gateway Protection will scan the email messages sent from the continuity mailbox based on its default outbound policy.

Administrators can configure and manage Email Continuity records on the Cloud Email Gateway Protection administrator console, and end users will be able to use the continuity mailbox to manage email messages on the End User Console.
