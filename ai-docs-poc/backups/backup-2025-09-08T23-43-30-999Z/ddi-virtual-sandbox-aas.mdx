Integrate the Deep Discovery Inspector virtual appliance with Sandbox as a Service to send object data to Trend Vision One.

Integrating Deep Discovery Inspector with Sandbox as a Service allows your deployed appliances to share suspicious objects and analysis data with Trend Vision One. Objects normally sent to the Virtual Analyzer for analysis are instead analyzed in the cloud by Sandbox as a Service. The results are sent to [Sandbox Analysis](sandbox-analysis.mdx) where they can be viewed. Additionally, suspicious objects are sent to [Suspicious Object Management](suspicious-object-management.mdx).

:::note

Connecting to a Service Gateway is not required to integrate with Sandbox as a Service.

Objects analyzed by Sandbox as a Service do not count towards the daily reserve for Sandbox Analysis.
:::

:::warning[Important]

You must have an activated Sandbox as a Service license to integrate with Trend Vision One. If you do not have a license for Sandbox as a Service, contact your support provider to obtain a license.

Additionally, if you deployed a disk image that was not specific to your organization, you must [activate your Deep Discovery Inspector license](activate-ddi-clp.mdx) before integrating with Sandbox as a Service.
