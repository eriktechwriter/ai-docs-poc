If you want to scan files and folders in network shares and mapped network drives that reside in a Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB) or Common Internet File System (CIFS), select *Enable Network Directory Scan*. This option is available only for real-time scans.

:::note

- Resources accessed in "*~/.gvfs*" via GVFS, a virtual file system available for the GNOME desktop, will be treated as local resources, not network drives.

- If a virus is detected when scanning a network folder on Windows, the agent may display some "clean failed" (delete failed) events.
