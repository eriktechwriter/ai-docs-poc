### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Data Identifiers**.

2.  Click the **Expression** tab.

3.  Click **Add**.

    A new screen displays.

4.  Type a name for the expression. The name must not exceed 100 bytes in length and cannot contain the following characters:

    - \> \< \* ^ | & ? \\ /

5.  Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.

6.  Type the displayed data.

    For example, if you are creating an expression for ID numbers, type a sample ID number. This data is used for reference purposes only and will not appear elsewhere in the product.

7.  Choose one of the following criteria and configure additional settings for the chosen criteria (see [Criteria for custom expressions](criteria-for-custom-expressions.mdx)):

    - None

    - Specific characters

    - Suffix

    - Single-character separator

8.  Test the expression against an actual data.

    For example, if the expression is for a national ID, type a valid ID number in the **Test data** text box, click **Test**, and then check the result.

9.  Click **Save** if you are satisfied with the result.

    :::note

    Save the settings only if the testing was successful. An expression that cannot detect any data wastes system resources and may impact performance.
