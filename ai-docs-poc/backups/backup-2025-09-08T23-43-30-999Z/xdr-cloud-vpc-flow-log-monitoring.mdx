July 8, 2024–Threat detection for AWS VPC Flow Logs is now available as a feature of XDR for Cloud. Once VPC flow log monitoring is enabled, Trend Vision One automatically analyzes the logs for any traffic activity related to suspicious or malicious IP addresses, and also monitors for malicious activity such as brute force attacks, access to sensitive database ports, data exfiltration, and more. Additionally, you can also use VPC flow logs to seep for indicators of compromise (IOCs) via the Threat Intelligence app, leveraging Trend Micro's threat intelligence feed or imported 3rd-party IOC sources.

- To enable VPC flow log monitoring, go to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → AWS**
