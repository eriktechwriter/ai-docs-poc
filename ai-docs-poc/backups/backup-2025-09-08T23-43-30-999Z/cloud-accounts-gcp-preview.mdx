March 25, 2024—As a pre-release preview feature, Cloud Accounts now supports connecting Google Cloud (GCP) projects to Trend Vision One. Connecting your Google Cloud project allows Trend Vision One to discover your cloud assets and rapidly identify risks such as compliance and security best practice violations on your cloud infrastructure. Once connected, cloud accounts and assets from your Google Cloud projects are visible in the Cloud Risk Management and Attack Surface Discovery apps under Cyber Risk Exposure Management. For more information, see [Google Cloud projects](google-cloud-projects.mdx).
