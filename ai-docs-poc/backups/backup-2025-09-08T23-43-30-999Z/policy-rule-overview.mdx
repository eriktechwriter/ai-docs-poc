Cloud Email Gateway Protection supports policy rules at the following levels in your organization: organization, group, and user.

- An organization-level policy rule applies to all of your organization's domains added to Cloud Email Gateway Protection.

  Organization-level policy rules ease your policy management by automatically applying to all of your organization's domains including the new ones added in the future. With organization-level policy rules, you do not need to manually create new policy rules in case that a new domain is added.

  Trend Micro recommends that you configure organization-level policy rules under **Inbound Protection** and **Outbound Protection** to provide organization-level protection.

- A group-level policy rule applies to one or more specific groups (including domains, LDAP groups and address groups) in your organization.

  :::tip

  If an existing domain-level policy rule is applying to all or the great majority of your organization's domains, you are advised to convert it into an organization-level policy rule and configure the rest of the domains as an exception list of the policy rule. This will simplify your policy management.
  :::

- A user-level policy rule applies to discrete email addresses that are or may be used by single users in your organization.

A policy rule level is determined by the **Recipients** or **Senders** addresses (depending on the mail traffic direction) that the policy applies to. The following table describes how to configure **Recipients** or **Senders** addresses for the policy rules at different levels. For more information, see [Specifying recipients and senders](specifying-recipients-senders.mdx).
