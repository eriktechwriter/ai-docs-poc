May 26, 2025—Data Detection and Response capabilities have been extended to Workbench. This update includes new features to help you safeguard your sensitive data:

- **Workbench alerts:** Track and investigate potential sensitive data leakage with timely notifications.

- **Data lineage graph:** Visualize how sensitive data is shared or transmitted within your environment.

To leverage these features, enable Data Security and create data policies to specify which network locations to monitor. Enhance your data protection strategy with these advanced tools, now available in Workbench.
