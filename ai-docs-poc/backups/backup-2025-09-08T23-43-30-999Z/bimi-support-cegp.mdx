December 9, 2024—Cloud Email Gateway Protection enhances your DMARC enforcement with Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI), allowing you to display your brand’s logo in recipient inboxes. Administrators can verify if their published BIMI records are correctly set up and active, or they can create a BIMI record and preview it in the administrator console before publishing it in DNS. This feature helps increase your brand visibility and builds customer trust.
