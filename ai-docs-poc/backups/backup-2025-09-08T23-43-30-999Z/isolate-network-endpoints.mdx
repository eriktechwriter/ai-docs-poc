Isolate at-risk endpoints to run an investigation and resolve security issues. Restore the connection promptly when all issues have been resolved.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Directories → Users/Endpoints**.

2.  Select to view endpoints.

3.  Click the name of an endpoint in the list.

4.  On the **Endpoint** information screen that appears, click **Task → Isolate**.

    Trend Micro Apex Central disables the **Isolate** option on endpoints for the following reasons:

    - The agent on the endpoint runs an unsupported version.

    - The user account used to log on to Trend Micro Apex Central does not have the necessary permissions.

5.  A message appears at the top of the **Endpoint** information screen that allows you to monitor the isolation status. After isolation completes, the message closes and a notification appears on the target endpoint to inform the user.

    If a problem occurs during the isolation process, the message at the top of the **Endpoint - {name}** screen informs you of the problem.

6.  To view all isolated endpoints on your Trend Micro Apex Central network, click the **Endpoints → Filters → Network Connection → Isolated** node in the User/Endpoint Directory tree.

7.  (Optional) To configure allowed inbound and outbound traffic to all isolated endpoints:

    1.  Click the **Control** hyperlink in the note on the screen that appears.

        </figure>

    2.  Select **Control traffic on isolated endpoints**.

    3.  Expand the **Inbound Traffic** or **Outbound Traffic** sections.

    4.  Specify the allowed traffic by specifying the **Protocol**, **IP Address**, and **Destination Port**.

        Separate multiple destination ports using commas.

    5.  Add multiple inbound and outbound entries by clicking the **-** control to the right of the **Destination Port** information.

    :::note

    After modifying the allowed traffic settings, all previously isolated endpoints and any endpoints isolated later apply the inbound and outbound traffic settings.
    :::

8.  After you have resolved the security threats on an isolated endpoint, restore network connectivity from the following locations:

    - **Endpoint** information screen: Click **Task → Restore**.

    - **Endpoints → Filters → Network Connection → Isolated**: Select the endpoint row in the table and click **Task → Restore Network Connection**.

9.  A message appears at the top of the screen that allows you to monitor the restoration status. After restoration completes, the message closes and a notification appears on the target endpoint to inform the user.

    If a problem occurs during the restoration process, the message at the top of the screen informs you of the problem.
