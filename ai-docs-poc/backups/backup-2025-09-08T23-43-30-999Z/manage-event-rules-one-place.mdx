December 18, 2023â€”**Threat and Exposure Management** now features **Event Rule Management**: a centralized location for you to manage risk event rules.

When you mark a risk event as Dismissed, an event rule is created to prevent Attack Surface Risk Management from reporting future instances of the risk event in **Risk Reduction Measures** and **All Risk Events**. The event rule also prevents the dismissed risk event from impacting your organization's Risk Index.

**Event Rule Management** allows you to review and manage all dismissed event rules. If you remove a dismissed event rule, all new instances of the risk event are reported and contribute to your organization's Risk Index.
