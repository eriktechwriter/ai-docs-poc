A worm is a self-contained program (or set of programs) able to spread functional copies of itself or its segments to other endpoint systems. The propagation usually takes place through network connections or email attachments. Worms are uncleanable because the file is a self-contained program.

Solution: Trend Micro recommends deleting worms.
