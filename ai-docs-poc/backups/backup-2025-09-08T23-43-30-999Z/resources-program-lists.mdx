Configure lists to define trusted programs to bypass firewall settings or exclude from security scans.

:::warning[Important]

If you are working on a policy, make sure to save your settings before leaving the screen. Leaving the screen without saving discards any changes.
:::

Programs lists are a policy resource you can configure to define trusted programs within your security environment. These lists are used by the following policy features:

- [Firewall](policies-firewall.mdx) to define trusted programs allowed to bypass the firewall

- [Exclusions](policies-exclusions.mdx) to define trusted programs excluded from security and anti-malware scans

You can add up to 250 program lists.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Policy Resources → Program Lists**.

2.  Create or edit a list.

    - To create a new list, click **Add program list**.

    - To edit an existing list, click the list name and go to **General**

3.  Specify a name and description for the list.

4.  Click the operating system you want to specify programs for.

    :::warning[Important]

    - You must specify at least one program per list. For example, specifying one program for Windows and not specifying a program for macOS or Linux is a valid list.

    - You can specify programs for more than one operating system per list. For example, specifying one program each for Windows, macOS, and Linux is a valid list.

    - You can specify up to a total of 125 items per list.
    :::

5.  Specify the **Full program path**.

    Program paths must be complete and follow the formatting guidelines for the specified operating system. The following formatting rules apply to the program lists:

    - Entry length maximum is 256 characters.

    - Entry cannot end with a slash (`/` or `\`).

    - Wildcards (`*`) and environmental variables are allowed. Windows allows using `?` as a wildcard.

    - Entry cannot be a relative path.

    - Entry cannot use a basename.

    - Folder and file names cannot contain certain special characters:

      - Windows: `\ / : " < > | ,`

      - Linux: `? < > | // , &`

      - macOS: `& = //`

6.  To add more programs, click **Add**.

    You can specify up to 125 items per list.
