View a visual representation of relationships between the trigger object and related objects.

The **Correlation Graph** provides an interactive visual graph you can use to investigate security events. There are several tools and actions you can take to focus on objects and relationships.

<p>Icons representing relevant information might appear next to an internal host. For example, if the internal host is on the Priority Server List or on a Trusted Service Source List, the graph displays the appropriate icon.
