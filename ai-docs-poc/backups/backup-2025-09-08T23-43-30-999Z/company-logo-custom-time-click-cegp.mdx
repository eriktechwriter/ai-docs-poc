February 18, 2025—You can now upload your company logo to replace the default Trend Micro logo when configuring the blocking and warning redirect pages for time-of-click protection. End users will see the customized logo when they encounter a blocked or warning page after clicking a potentially malicious URL. This enhancement strengthens your brand presence and provides a seamless and familiar experience for your users in security alerts.
