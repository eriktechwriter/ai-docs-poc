Configure a list of trusted paths and folders to exclude from Anti-Malware scans.

:::warning[Important]

If you are working on a policy, make sure to save your settings before leaving the screen. Leaving the screen without saving discards any changes.

Directory lists are a policy resource you can use to define trusted and sensitive locations (paths, folders, and directories) on your endpoints to exclude from [Anti-Malware](policies-anti-malware.mdx) scans. You can add up to 250 directory lists.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Policy Resources → Directory Lists**.

2.  Create or edit a list.

    - To create a new list, click **Add directory list**.

    - To edit an existing list, click the list name and go to **General**

3.  Specify a name and description for the list.

4.  Specify a **Directory**.

    Directory paths must be complete and follow the formatting guidelines for the specified operating system. The following formatting rules apply to the directory lists:

    - Entry length maximum is 256 characters.

    - Entry must end with a slash (Linux, macOS `/` or Windows `\`).

    - Wildcards (`*`) and environmental variables are allowed. Windows allows using `?` as a wildcard.

    - Entry cannot be a relative path.

    - Folder names cannot contain certain special characters:

      - Windows: `\ / : " < > | ,`

      - Linux: `? < > | // , &`

      - macOS: `& = //`

5.  To add more directories, click **Add**.

    You can specify up to 125 items per list.

6.  Click **Save**.
