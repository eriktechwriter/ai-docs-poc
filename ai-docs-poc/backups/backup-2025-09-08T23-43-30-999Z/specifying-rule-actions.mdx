### Procedure {#procedure}

- To add actions to a policy rule definition, select the desired action.

- To specify details of an action (where required), select the drop-down list, text field, or link that provides more detail for the policy rule.

  For example, if the quarantine action is desired, you need to select which quarantine to send messages to when they trigger this policy rule. You also might want to create a new quarantine based on an existing one. You can click **Edit** there to begin that process.
