October 21, 2024—Cloud Email Gateway Protection now supports enabling quarantined email preview in quarantine digest templates. This feature allows administrators to decide whether end users can preview quarantined emails in quarantine digests. The quarantine digest preview supports inline actions for improved user interaction, including options to deliver emails or approve senders.

Additionally, enhancements are also made to allow end users and administrators to view HTML-rendered email content in the End User Console or the Quarantine Query Details screen.
