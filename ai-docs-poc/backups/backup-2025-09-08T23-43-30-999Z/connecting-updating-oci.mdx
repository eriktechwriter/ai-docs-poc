Add your Oracle Cloud compartments to provide visibility into your cloud environment.

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with administrator privileges for the compartment you wish to connect, and that you are logged into the compartment on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. Review the [required permissions](oracle-required-granted-permissions.mdx) and [regional limitations](oracle-supported-regions.mdx) to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources.

Once you are ready, [connect your Oracle Cloud compartment](adding-oracle-cloud-compartment.mdx).
