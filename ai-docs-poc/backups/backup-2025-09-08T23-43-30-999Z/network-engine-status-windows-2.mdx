## What are Network Engine Status warnings {#what-are-network-engine-status-warnings}

Network Engine Status warnings are a collection of warnings/errors that might appear in the [Status area](overview-section-computer-editor.mdx) of a computer. They appear when the agent raises an event about the *Trend Micro LightWeight Filter Driver*, and the [Network Engine Status Check](network-engine-settings.mdx) feature is enabled.

If you get one of these warnings, network features might not function on that agent.
