On the *Computers* page in the Server & Workload Protection console:

- The *Status* column displays the state of the computer's network connectivity and the state (in parentheses) of the agent providing protection, if present. The status column might also display system or agent events. See Status column - computer states and Status column - agent states
- The Task(s) column displays the state of the tasks. See Task(s) column.

For a list of the events, see [Agent event descriptions](agent-events.mdx) and [System events](system-events.mdx).

<td><p>Scan for Open Ports</p></td>
<td>Performs a port scan on all selected computers and checks the agent installed on the computer to determine whether its state is either Deactivation Required, Activation Required, Agent Reactivate Required, or Online. The scan operation, by default, scans ports 1-1024. This range can be changed in <em>Computer or Policy editor &gt; Settings &gt; General</em>.


:::note

The agent's listening port number for heartbeats is always scanned regardless of port range settings. When Server &amp; Workload Protection connects to communicate with the agent, it uses that port number. If communication direction is set to "Agent/Appliance Initiated" for a computer (<em>Computer or Policy editor &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Communication Direction</em>), however, that port number will not be open.

### Status information for different types of computers {#status-information-for-different-types-of-computers}

The circular icon indicates the overall status for the agent or the module:

- Green: No issues
- Yellow: An issue has been found
- Red: A critical issue has been found
- Gray: Unable to find or to check for issues. It may be that a module has been turned off, or that even though the module has been turned on, there are no rules associated with the module and the module cannot report any result.

### Ordinary computer {#ordinary-computer}

The preview pane for an ordinary computer displays the presence of an agent, it status, and the status of the protection modules.
