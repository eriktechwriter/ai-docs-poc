By leveraging a combination of user-defined passwords and message content (subject, body and attachment names), Cloud Email Gateway Protection can heuristically extract or open password-protected files, namely, archive files and document files, in email messages to detect any malicious payload that may be embedded in those files.

You can add or import user-defined passwords to help Cloud Email Gateway Protection efficiently extract or open password-protected files for further scanning.

:::note

File password analysis is only applied for virus scan, and not for DLP or content filtering.
