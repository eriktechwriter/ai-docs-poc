Learn about creating user-defined playbooks to improve your company's response to possible security risks.

Create user-defined playbooks from scratch to meet the specific security needs of your company, such as assessing and mitigating account configuration risks and automatically responding to Workbench alerts. Depending on the type of playbook, user-defined playbooks can be executed manually or periodically, or provide automated responses when enabled.

User-defined playbooks consist of [various node types](playbook-nodes.mdx) that allow you to trigger execution, define the target of the playbook, handle conditions, and carry out actions. The following table describes the user-defined playbooks on the **Playbooks** tab.
