You have two options for subscribing to File Security:

- **Credit pricing**. You can purchase credits for either files scanned, or if you are using File Security Storage, per bucket or files scanned.

- **Pay-as-you-go pricing**. You can subscribe to Trend Vision One File Security and only pay for what you deploy and use. You are billed based on your usage of the File Security services, reported on an hourly basis. You sign up for pay-as-you-go billing on the AWS Marketplace.

The table below compares the pricing for File Security's features for both credit and pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Switch between pricing models {#switch-between-pricing-models}

To switch supported Trend Vision One features between credit-based licensing and pay-as-you-go, click **Manage billing model**.

- You must have a pay-as-you-go contract to manage features' billing models. For more information, see Purchasing a pay-as-you-go contract from AWS Marketplace.

- If you have already purchased a contract, the **Manage Billing Model** window appears. Use the buttons next to each supported feature to select a billing model, then click **Continue** to review and confirm your changes.

  :::warning[Important]

  You can change the billing model of each feature once every 30 days. Once you change the billing model of a feature, you must wait 30 days to change the billing model back.

### Notes on pay-as-you-go pricing {#notes-on-pay-as-you-go-pricing}

- SDK and Storage can be configured separately for using credit or pay-as-you-go.

- The number of scans made are updated every hour.

- If you are using pay-as-you-go for buckets, you are charged each hour that the bucket is protected, even if no scans are made.
