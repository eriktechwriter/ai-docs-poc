August 4, 2025—Configure service level agreement (SLA) metrics to track whether case handling complies with your SLA requirements. You can apply SLA metrics based on case priority or to all cases regardless of priority level. Workbench, Risk Event, and Compliance Management case types support SLA metrics. SLA metrics appear in the Mean Time Metrics, Mean Time to Close, and My Open Case widgets.

For more information, see [Configure service level agreement (SLA) targets & notifications](config-sla-targets.mdx).
