**AI Application Security** enables you to intercept malicious inputs and block potentially harmful outputs from your AI models, which helps to prevent exploitative usage and maintain regulatory compliance.

Go to **Cloud Security → Security for AI Stack → AI Application Security** and click **Get started** under either AI Scanner or AI Guard, depending on your use case:

- AI Scanner: Scan your AI models for common attack techniques and objectives to prevent malicious use and ensure regulatory compliance.

  For more information on configuring a scan, see [Configure scan settings](configure-ai-scanner-scan-settings.mdx).

- AI Guard: Configure settings to scan your AI usage for harmful content generation, sensitive information leakage, and prompt injections.

  For more information on integrating AI Guard with your application, see [Integrate AI Guard](integrate-ai-guard.mdx).
