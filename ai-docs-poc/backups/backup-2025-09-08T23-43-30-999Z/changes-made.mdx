Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection adds some data to Microsoft 365, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Gmail during the access grant process or when scanning those cloud applications and services. If your license expires, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection automatically removes service accounts for you and cleans up most of the data. You must manually remove the remaining data.
