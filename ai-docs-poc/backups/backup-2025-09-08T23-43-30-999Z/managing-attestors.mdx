This topic explains how to create, edit, and delete attestors (Cosign public keys) for use in container image signature verification.

Attestors are trusted Cosign public keys in PEM format used to verify the digital signatures of container images. They ensure that the images originate from a trusted source and have not been tampered with.

:::note

To validate Trend Micro container images, see [How do I verify the authenticity of Trend Micro container images with Cosign public keys?](container-security-faqs.mdx).
:::

Prerequisites:

- You have a Cosign public key in PEM format. This key corresponds to the private key that was used to sign your container images.

  For instructions on how to create a Cosign public key, see [Signing Containers](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/signing_with_containers/) on the Sigstore documentation site.

- Your account has the necessary permissions to access the **Object Management** section in Container Protection.

:::warning[Important]

To ensure the security and integrity of your container images, follow these best practices when managing attestors:

- Regularly update attestors to include new trusted keys.

- Remove attestors that are no longer needed or have been compromised.

- Ensure the corresponding private keys are stored securely by the development team and that access to them is restricted.
