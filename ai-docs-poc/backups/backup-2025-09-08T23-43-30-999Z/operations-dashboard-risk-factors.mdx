Threat and Exposure Management now monitors two new risk factors: System Configuration and Security Configuration. You can view the related risk metrics and events in the Risk Factors tab.

Risk Insights identifies potential misconfigurations of your environment, including exposed ports, insecure host connections, insecure IAM and cloud infrastructure configurations, and unsafe software and endpoint configurations.

Risk Insights monitors your Trend Micro security settings, including endpoint agent and sensor deployments, update status, and key feature adoption rates. The Security Configuration risk factor helps you ensure that Trend Micro solution settings are following best practices.
