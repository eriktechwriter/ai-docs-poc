Use QuickLaunch to connect your AWS account to the Cloud Accounts app.

:::warning[Important]

Connecting an AWS account using QuickLaunch is a pre-release feature and is not part of the existing features of an official commercial or general release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

This feature is not available in all regions.

This feature can only be used with an AWS account which you have used to purchase Trend Vision One credits from the AWS Marketplace. For all other accounts, see [Adding an AWS account using CloudFormation](adding-aws-account.mdx).

The steps for AWS QuickLaunch and the AWS CloudFlare console are valid as of November 2023.
:::

If you have purchased a Trend Vision One credits subscription through the AWS Marketplace, you can connect your AWS account to Cloud Accounts using the QuickLaunch feature in AWS. Connecting an account using this method automatically enables the Cloud Accounts Core Features. After you successfully connect your AWS account, you can perform a [stack update](stack-update.mdx) to enable additional features and settings.

    The Trend Vision One console sign in appears in a new tab.

7.  Sign in to the Trend Vision One console.

    If you have not already activated your credits license, the **Activate your Trend Micro Solutions** screen appears after signing in. Review the license details and click **Activate**.

8.  Once you have signed in and have access to the Trend Vision One console, go back to the AWS QuickLaunch screen.

9.  Under **Step 3: Configure your software and AWS integration**, click **Launch template** on the **AWS CloudFormation** tab.

10. Select the region to deploy the template.

11. If the deployment parameters do not exist in the selected region, click **Replicate parameters**.
