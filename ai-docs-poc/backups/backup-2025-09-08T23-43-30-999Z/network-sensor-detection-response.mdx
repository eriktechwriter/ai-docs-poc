June 5, 2023—Virtual Network Sensor is the new network sensor solution available for Trend Vision One. Virtual Network Sensor is a virtual appliance that provides Trend Vision One with network activity data, enabling you to review detailed network activity. The network data can also help discover unmanaged and unknown network assets, allowing for a more holistic view of your attack surface for network detection, response, analysis, and visibility.

Start your Trend Vision One journey by providing needed network detection and response capabilities such as network telemetry collection and investigation responses. Get an overview of your connected Virtual Network Sensor virtual appliances in Network Inventory.
