This widget checks the number of DLP incident trends based on managed users. Data can be filtered by severity level, or filtered to show only the total number of incidents triggered by a specific user for a specified period of time. By default the widget displays data from all the managed products that a user's account privileges allow.

:::warning[Important]

This widget only displays data for Trend Vision One user accounts that have been assigned Data Loss Prevention (DLP) user roles.

For more information about reviewing DLP incidents and configuring DLP user roles, see <https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/apex-central-saas/dlp_incidents>.
