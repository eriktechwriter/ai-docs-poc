Server & Workload Protection is configured to allow a maximum number of TCP connections to protected computers. When the number of connections exceeds the maximum, network traffic is dropped and Max TCP Connections firewall events occur. To prevent dropped connections, increase the maximum allowed TCP connections on the computer where the Max TCP Connection event occurs.

:::note

The intrusion protection module enables the network engine which enforces the allowed number of TCP connections.
