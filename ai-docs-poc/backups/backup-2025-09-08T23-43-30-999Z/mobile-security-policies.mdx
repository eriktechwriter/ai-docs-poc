Implement security policies that establish rules for how mobile devices are used and secured within your organization.

A security policy is a collection of security settings used to monitor the security status of each managed device.

You can assign multiple security policies to the same device. The policy with the highest priority will be evaluated to assign a risk level to the device.

The following table outlines the actions available on the **Mobile Policy** screen (**Mobile Security â†’ Mobile Security Policies**).
