August 14, 2023—Five new widgets have been added to the Security Dashboard widget catalog:

- Activity Data Statistics

- Detection Statistics

- Endpoint Statistics

- Email Threat Detection Overview

- Email Spam Detection Overview

The new widgets provide an overview of all activity data and detections, allowing users to spot issues involving endpoints and email security and then go deeper to pinpoint product connector or configuration errors. Find the new widgets in the XDR Threat Investigation and Email categories of the Dashboards widget catalog.
