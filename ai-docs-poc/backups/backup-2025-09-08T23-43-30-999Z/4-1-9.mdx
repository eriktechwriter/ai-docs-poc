Profile applicability: Level 1 - Worker Node

Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.

The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, the `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` file as set up by `kubeadm` has permissions of 600.

### Audit {#audit}

Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the \<PATH\>/\<FILENAME\> of the kubelet config yaml file. Set $kubelet_config_yaml=\<PATH\> based on the file location on your system:

``` codeblock
export kubelet_config_yaml=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

To perform the audit manually, run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

``` codeblock
stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the Audit step):

``` codeblock
chmod 600 /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```
