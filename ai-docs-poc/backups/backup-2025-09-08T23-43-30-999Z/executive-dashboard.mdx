Get better insights into your companyâ€™s security posture by understanding your overall cyber risk index, asset risks, ongoing attacks, and all contributing risk factors.

Cyber Risk Overview provides information about your company's overall Cyber Risk Index, which is a comprehensive score based on the dynamic assessment of risk factors in your organization.

The Cyber Risk Index automatically updates every four hours. Changes to the status of risk events are reflected in the Cyber Risk Index after up to one hour. You may also manually recalculate the Cyber Risk Index by clicking **Recalculate**. Manual recalculations take up to one hour to display.

:::note

When you allocate credits to Cyber Risk Exposure Management, only assets you have enabled for assessment are used to calculate the Cyber Risk Index. If you have recently enabled only desktop and server or cloud account assessment, your displayed Cyber Risk Index may drop significantly due to fewer assets available for assessment. To learn more about Cyber Risk Exposure Management credit requirements, see [Credit requirements for Trend Vision One solutions, capabilities, and features](credit-req-for-apps-services.mdx).

To gain more comprehensive insights and accurate organizational comparisons, connect more [data sources](configuring-data-sources.mdx), and configure your industry and company size in your [Company Profile](business-profile.mdx).

Data availability depends on the asset visibility scope of the current user. For more information about asset visibility scope, see [Asset Visibility Management](asset-visibility-management.mdx).
