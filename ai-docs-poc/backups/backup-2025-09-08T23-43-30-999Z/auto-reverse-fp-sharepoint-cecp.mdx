August 15, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection automatically reverses false positive quarantines in SharePoint Online, in addition to OneDrive. Using advanced URL pattern intelligence, it identifies false positives, retrieves file details from detection logs, and restores affected files to their original locations—no manual action needed.
