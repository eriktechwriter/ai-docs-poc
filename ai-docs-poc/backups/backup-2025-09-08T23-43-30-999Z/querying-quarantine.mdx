Use the **Query** screen to view a list of quarantined messages for your managed domains. You can review the messages, delete them, or release them for further scanning.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **Period** field, specify the time range for your query.

    :::note

    Queries include data for up to 30 continuous days in one calendar month. Use more than one query to search across calendar months.
    :::

2.  In the **Direction** field, select a mail traffic direction.

3.  Type your search criteria into one or more of the following fields:

    - **Recipient**: The envelope recipient address.

    - **Sender**: The envelope sender address.

    - **Subject**: The email message subject.

    You can specify up to 10 recipients or senders. Separate multiple recipients or senders by pressing the **ENTER** or **TAB** key, or using a semicolon (;).

    A recipient or sender can be a specific email address or all addresses from a specific domain.

    - Query a specific email address by typing that email address.

    - Query all addresses from a domain by using an asterisk (\*) to the left of the at sign (@) in the email address. For example, `*@example.com` will search for all email addresses in the `example.com` domain.

    The following table provides format examples that are valid and invalid:

    **Format Examples for Mail Tracking and Quarantine Query**

    <table>

    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th><p>Valid</p></th>
    <th><p>Invalid</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p><code>name@info.example.com</code></p></td>
    <td><p><code>name@*.example.com</code></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p><code>*@example.com</code></p></td>
    <td><p><code>*@*.com</code></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p><code>*@server.example.com</code></p></td>
    <td><p><code>*@*</code></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><p><code>*@*.example.com</code></p></td>
    </tr>

4.  In the **Visibility** field, specify whether to query quarantined messages that end users have access to.

    - **All**: Query all quarantined messages.

    - **Invisible to End Users**: Query the quarantined messages that end users do not have access to.

    - **Visible to End Users**: Query the quarantined messages that end users have access to.

    Quarantined incoming messages that end users have access to depend on your setting based on quarantine reasons on the **End User Quarantine Settings** screen. Quarantined outgoing messages are always invisible to end users.

    - ![](/images/deliver=GUID-6EB66433-B46F-42FF-8279-BFF928DA37BE=2=en-us=Low.webp) **Deliver**: Release from quarantine

      :::note

      Released messages will no longer trigger the exact policy rule that caused the messages to be quarantined, but they will continue to be processed by Cloud Email Gateway Protection. The following conditions apply to delivery:

      - If a message triggers a content-based policy rule with an **Intercept** action of **Quarantine**, it will once again appear in the quarantined message list.

      - If a message triggers a content-based policy rule with an **Intercept** action of **Delete entire message** or **Change recipient**, it will not arrive at its intended destination.

      The content-based policy rule mentioned above refers to any policy rule that evaluates email messages based on message contents. Typical content-based policy rules include virus policies, spam policies, content filtering policies, and DLP policies.

        :::note

        If the email header exceeds 20 KB, only the first 20 KB is displayed. For messages larger than 1 MB, the HTML content is not rendered. Instead, the message is displayed as truncated HTML source code on the **HTML** tab.
        :::

    2.  Click **Delete**, **Deliver**, or **Download** to manage the message.

        When you click ![](/images/Download_icon=GUID-80D31FB3-4EC8-4B68-BD88-23620D8B4C74=1=en-us=Low.webp)**Download**, choose whether to download the original email file or password-protected ZIP file to your local host.

        When you download the ZIP file, Cloud Email Gateway Protection generates a password for decompressing the ZIP file. You can find the password on the **Quarantine Query Details** screen or at the end of the ZIP file name.
