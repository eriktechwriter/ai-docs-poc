June 16, 2025—To provide proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for console settings, only “Master Administrator” and “Operator" can edit pre-defined roles. "Endpoint Administrator" and "Email Administrator" can still view the **Console Settings** page, but no longer have the permissions required to make changes to it.

For more details, see [Console Settings](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-vision-one-console-settings).
