Learn about the information available in Attack Overview within Cyber Risk Overview, including summaries of threats under the XDR Detection and Threat Detection risk factors.

**Attack Overview** displays your organization's risk level within the attack risk category, which is averaged from the daily attack intensity of all detected cyber threats in each attack phase. Factors considered when determining attack risk include:

- Number of known threat detections

- Number of impacted assets

- Severity of each unique threat type detected

Daily attack scores are averaged from the maximum attack intensity of all detected cyber threats over the last 14 days. You can view your attack scores from the last 30 days on the attack overview trend graph. A high attack score indicates that you may need to review and reinforce your security configuration.

:::warning[Important]

The attack risk level is calculated using all data received from your business without applying asset visibility scope limits.

<td><p>Displays trending daily attack scores from the last 30 days, demonstrating the rise and fall of the volume of attack waves received by your organization. Compare your trending attack wave volume with organizations of similar size, in the same region, or part of the same industry.</p>


:::note

<p>Attack scores on the trend graph represent the relative volume of detected attacks, including those detected and prevented by your security configuration. A high attack score requires attention, but significant changes in the attack score (from low to medium, for example) are also noteworthy and mean you should strengthen your security posture.</p>
