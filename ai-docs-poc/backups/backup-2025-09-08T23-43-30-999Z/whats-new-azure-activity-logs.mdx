May 5, 2025—XDR for Cloud is now available for Azure environments, with support for Azure Activity Logs in public preview. Enable cloud detections for Azure Activity Logs in your Azure subscription to gain actionable insights into user, service, and resource activity. Detection models identify suspicious and malicious activities such as privilege escalation, attempted data exfiltration, critical resource and service disruption, and more.

For more information, see [Azure features and permissions](azure-features-permissions.mdx).
