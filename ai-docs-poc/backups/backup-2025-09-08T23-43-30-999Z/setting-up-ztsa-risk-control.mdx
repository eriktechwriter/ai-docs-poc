<td><p>You can grant certain permissions within your IAM system to enable Zero Trust Secure Access to monitor user sign-in attempts, access user data, and perform actions on user accounts. For more information, see <a href="trend-vision-one-ia-manage-integration-ztsa">Identity and access management integration</a></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Devices</p></td>
<td><p>During rule execution, Risk Control is not effective if you did not install an endpoint sensor across device control, private access, internet access, and AI access. This means that if you are setting up a device-based risk control rule, you must have Trend Vision One Endpoint Security already installed.</p>


:::note

<p>In Endpoint Security, you must also enable <strong>Endpoint sensor detection and response</strong> on managed agents.</p>
