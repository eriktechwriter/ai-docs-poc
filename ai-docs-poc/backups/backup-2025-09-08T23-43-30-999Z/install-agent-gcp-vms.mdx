Read this page if you want to protect existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM instances with Server & Workload Protection.

To protect your existing GCP VMs:

1.  Add a GCP service account to the Server & Workload Protection console. For instructions, see [Add a Google Cloud Platform account](add-google-cloud-platform-account.mdx).

2.  Configure agent-initiated activation (AIA). For instructions, see [Activate and protect agents using agent-initiated activation and communication](agent-initiated-activation.mdx).

3.  Open ports so that Server & Workload Protection components can access your GCP VMs and the GCP API. For information on which ports to open, see [Server & Workload Protection Port numbers](swp-port-numbers.mdx). For instructions on how to open ports, see [this GCP webpage](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls).

4.  Deploy agents to your GCP VMs. You must use agent version 12 or later. To deploy agents, you have two options:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 60%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th><p>Option</p></th>
    <th><p>Use if...</p></th>
    <th><p>Instructions</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Option 1:</p>
    <p>Use a deployment script to install, activate, and assign a policy to the agent</p></td>
    <td><p>You need to deploy many agents to your GCP VMs.</p></td>
    <td><p>See <a href="trend-vision-one-deployment-scripts-add-computers">Use deployment scripts to add and protect computers</a> for instructions.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Option 2:</p>
    <p>Manually install and activate the agent</p></td>
    <td><p>You only need to deploy a few agents.</p></td>
    <td><ol>
    <li>Obtain the agent software, copy it to the GCPVM, and then install it. For details, see <a href="trend-vision-one-get-agent-software">Get agent software.</a></li>
    <li>Activate the agent. You can do so on the agent or on the Server &amp; Workload Protection console. For details, see <a href="trend-vision-one-activate-agent">Activate the agent.</a></li>
    </ol></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

5.  Verify that the agent was installed and activated properly:

    1.  Log in to the Server & Workload Protection console.
    2.  Click *Computers* at the top.
    3.  On the navigation pane on the left, make sure your GCP VM appears under **Computers → your_GCP_service_account → your_GCP_project**.
    4.  In the main pane, make sure your GCP VMs appear with a *Status* of *Managed (Online)* and a green dot next to them.

6.  Assign a policy if you installed and activated the agent manually. For instructions, see [Assign a policy to a computer](create-policies.mdx). Assigning the policy sends the necessary protection modules to the agent so that your computer is protected.

    :::note

    Skip the policy assignment step if you ran a deployment script to install and activate the agent. The script already assigned a policy so no further action is required.
    :::

After assigning a policy, your GCP VM is now protected.
