A public cloud app profile details the reputation of a public cloud application as determined by Trend Micro experts and how often your organization accesses the app.

A public cloud app is any publicly accessible cloud-based service. Example public cloud app service types include Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Example public cloud app categories evaluated by Cloud Reputation Services include:

:::warning[Important]

<p>A public cloud application's reputation indicates a level of maturity and security compliance for the application and does not indicate that an application is malicious or dangerous. Trend Micro experts constantly evaluate, assess, and adjust public cloud application reputations based on many criteria to ensure you always have the latest information.</p>
<p>Trend Micro cannot guarantee that the available information about an app is complete. Customize the risk level of apps you think have been assessed inaccurately.</p>
