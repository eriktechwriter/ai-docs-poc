Exclude directories, files, and file extensions from the malware scan. For real-time scans, you can also exclude process image files.

Examples of files and folders to exclude:

- If you are creating a malware scan configuration for a Microsoft Exchange server, exclude the SMEX quarantine folder to avoid re-scanning files that have already been confirmed to be malware.

- If you have large VMware images, exclude the directory containing these images if you experience performance issues.

:::tip

You can also exclude files from Anti-Malware scanning when they are signed by a trusted digital certificate. This type of exclusion is defined in policy or computer settings. (See [Exclude files signed by a trusted certificate](create-anti-malware-exceptions.mdx).)
