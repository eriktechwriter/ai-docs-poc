June 20, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection enhances its email reporting feature by allowing administrators to control whether reported Exchange Online emails—matching the approved header field list configured under Global Settings—are sent to Trend Micro for further analysis. This provides greater flexibility for admins to manage data handling based on organizational policies and privacy considerations.
