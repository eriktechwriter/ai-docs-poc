Apex One blocks all attempts to terminate the following Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent services:

- Apex One NT Listener (`TmListen.exe`)

- Apex One NT RealTime Scan (`NTRtScan.exe`)

- Apex One NT Firewall (`TmPfw.exe`)

- Trend Micro Apex One Data Protection Service (`dsagent.exe`)

- Trend Micro Unauthorized Change Prevention Service (`TMBMSRV.exe`)

  :::note

  If this option is enabled, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent may prevent third-party products from installing successfully on endpoints. If you encounter this issue, you can temporarily disable the option and then re-enable it after the installation of the third-party product.
