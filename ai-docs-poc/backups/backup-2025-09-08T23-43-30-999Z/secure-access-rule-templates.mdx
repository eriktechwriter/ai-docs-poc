Use templates to define your organization's secure access rules for users and devices.

Trend Vision One provides a set of pre-defined rule templates that correlate to different types of information you want to gather about your network environment. You can create a risk control rule from a template, fine-tune the rule to achieve expected results, and add automated actions to respond to and remediate risks automatically.

The following table describes the **Risk Control** rule templates.
