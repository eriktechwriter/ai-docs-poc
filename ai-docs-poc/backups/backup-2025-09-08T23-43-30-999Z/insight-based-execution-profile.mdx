The insight-based execution profile allows you to focus on objects and events across affected endpoints from a broader perspective, rather than isolated, discrete alerts that may point to the same underlying root cause.

By correlating and grouping related alerts, the insight-based execution profile visualizes objects and events on multiple analysis chains to facilitate interactive investigation.

The following table describes the elements that comprise the insight-based execution profile.

<p>Click <strong>View event</strong> to further examine the event details in the <strong>Observed Attack Techniques</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Observed Attack Techniques</strong> only lists detection filters at <em>Critical</em>, <em>High</em>, and <em>Medium</em> risk levels based on the objects available in the current analysis chain.</p></td>

<td><p>Aggregates multiple analysis chains that visualize objects and events for interactive investigations</p>
<p>Click any node to view the detailed profile and check related events of the object. The initial analysis chain shows the most critical events as a baseline and allows you to add more events to the chain if necessary.</p></td>

<p>Trend Vision One highlights only the first observed events of an insight. Use the right arrow (<img src="./images/Workbench_right_arrow=GUID-086A3484-09C5-4182-8C88-8B5D59C8E61F=1=en-us=Low.webp" />) to progress through the attack step-by-step.</p></td>
