Cross-sign your CA certificate with the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file provided by Internet Access for use by Internet Access Gateways.

Internet Access allows administrators to cross-sign your organization's own CA certificate with the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file provided by Trend Micro, and upload the cross-signed certificate on the Trend Vision One management console. Cross-signing the CA certificate establishes a trusted relationship between the Trend Micro CA certificate and your organization's own CA certificate.

:::note

Internet Access provides different CSR files for the cloud gateway and on-premises gateways.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Check the following:

    - Your organization's CA certificate and the corresponding CA private key and its passphrase are already available.

    - The **Path Length Constraint** in your organization's CA certificate is set to **None**, so that there is no restriction on the CA certificates down in the hierarchy.

    - The administrator has a basic knowledge of openssl commands.

2.  Go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access Configuration**.

3.  Click the **HTTPS Inspection** tab.

4.  Click the **Settings** gear icon in the upper right.

5.  Click **Download CSR** and select the gateway type to download the corresponding CSR file to your local machine.

6.  Create a folder on your local machine and specify a name for the folder, for example, `CrossSignIAGCA_cloud` for the cloud gateway, `CrossSignIAGCA_onprem` for the on-premises gateway.

    :::note

    The names of the folders and files created in this section are customizable.
    :::

7.  Go to the newly created folder.

8.  Create a subfolder named `newcerts`.

9.  Create an empty file named `certindex`.

10. Create a file, copy and paste the following text, and then save it as `serialfile` in the folder that you created in step 6:

    ``` codeblock
    a000
    ```

11. Move the downloaded CSR file to the folder that you created in step 6, and rename it to `iag_ca.csr`.

12. Create a file, copy and paste the following text into the file, and then save it as a configuration file named `myca.conf` in the folder that you created in step 6:

    ``` codeblock
    [ca]
    default_ca = rootca

    [crl_ext]
    #issuerAltName=issuer:copy  #this would copy the issuer name to altname
    authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always

    [rootca]
    new_certs_dir = newcerts
    unique_subject = no
    certificate = root.cer  #Your organization's CA certificate
    database = certindex
    private_key = root.key  #Your organization's CA private key
    serial = serialfile
    default_days = 3660     #Should be at least two years from the date of cross-signing
    default_md = sha256     #sha256, sha 384, sha512 are supported.
    policy = myca_policy
    x509_extensions = myca_extensions

    [ myca_policy ]
    countryName = optional
    stateOrProvinceName = optional
    localityName = optional
    organizationName = supplied
    organizationalUnitName = optional
    commonName = supplied
    emailAddress = optional

    [ myca_extensions ]     #These extensions are required.
    basicConstraints = CA:true
    subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always
    keyUsage = keyCertSign, cRLSign
    ```

13. Run the following command to cross-sign your organization's CA certificate using the CSR file:

    `openssl ca -batch -config myca.conf -notext -days 7320 -in iag_ca.csr -out iag_ca.cer`

    A cross-signed certificate named `0A.pem` is generated under folder `newcerts`.
