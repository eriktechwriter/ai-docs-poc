April 7, 2025— We are pleased to announce that the AWS Organizations deployment in Cloud Accounts now supports deployment to multiple Organizational Units (OUs) simultaneously. This enhancement streamlines the process, allowing for more efficient and scalable management of your AWS resources. For more information, see [Adding an AWS Organization](adding-aws-organizations.mdx).
