::: {role="main"}
This alert indicates that the rate at which integrity monitoring information is collected has been temporarily delayed. The delay is due to an increase in the volume of integrity monitoring data that is being transmitted from agents to Server & Workload Protection. During this time the baseline and integrity monitoring event views may not be current for some computers.

This alert is automatically dismissed when the collection of integrity monitoring data is no longer delayed.

For more information about integrity monitoring, see [Set up Integrity Monitoring](set-up-integrity-monitoring.mdx).
