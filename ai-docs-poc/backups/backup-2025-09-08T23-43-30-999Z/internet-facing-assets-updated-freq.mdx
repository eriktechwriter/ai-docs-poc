April 15, 2022—Thanks to several backend improvements, data for your internet-facing assets are now updated more often. The increased update frequency allows you to better assess your attack surface in **Attack Surface Discovery**, particularly after removing domains and IP addresses and renewing certificates, and improves the accuracy of risk events created in Threat and Exposure Management. For more information, see [Internet-Facing Assets](internet-facing-assets.mdx).
