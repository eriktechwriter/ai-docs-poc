::: {role="main"}
May 31, 2024—Endpoint Security now includes Runtime Proxy Settings, enabling the ability to create and manage proxy policies with detailed settings which can be applied to different endpoint groups.

Runtime Proxy Policies allow you to assign endpoint groups to connect to specific Service Gateways or different third-party proxies based on the needs of your environment. Additionally, you can now separately configure proxies for use during agent deployment and installation.
