July 1, 2024—As part of the Identity Security app group, Identity Inventory offers comprehensive identity tracking and management features for both human and non-human identities as well as assigned entitlements and privileges. View summaries of groups, roles, and devices registered with your identity provider, and see the current status of passwords and conditional access certificates to ensure your security practices are up to date. To get started, grant read and write permissions to your Microsoft Entra ID tenant in **Third-Party Integration**.
