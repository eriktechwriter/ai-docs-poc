March 10, 2025—Detection Model Management now provides pre-built templates to help you create custom filters more efficiently.

Filter templates serve as starting points that you can customize to detect specific events in your environment. Each template comes with predefined settings and queries that you can modify according to your security needs, making easier to implement detection rules without starting from scratch.

For more information, see [Use a template to create a custom filter](use-template-create-custom-filter.mdx).
