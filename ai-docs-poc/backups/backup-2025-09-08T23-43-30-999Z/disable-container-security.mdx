You can easily disable Container Security on a cluster if you no longer require protection.

Disabling Container Security on Kubernetes and Amazon ECS clusters is a straightforward task. For Kubernetes clusters, you can also [uninstall the Helm chart](removing-kubernetes-helm-chart.mdx) to remove Container Security. For Amazon ECS clusters, there are other methods available if you want to [remove protection at the account level](remove-container-aws-account.mdx).
