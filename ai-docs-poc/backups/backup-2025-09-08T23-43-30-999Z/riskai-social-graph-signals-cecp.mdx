January 10, 2025—Besides the existing recipient-based social graph related detection signals, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection adds two more predefined detection signals of this type. The signals check for the newly observed sender addresses and domains based on companies within the last 30 days to help anomaly detection in the customer’s environment.

These detection signals are not available in all regions.
