### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **Recipients** section, choose either of the following ways to add recipient addresses from the drop-down list:

    - **My organization**: Select it to configure an organization-level policy.

      :::note

      This option is available only if **My organization** was specified for your subaccount during subaccount creation.
      :::

    - **Specify**:

      - **My domains**: Select domains from the available domains and click **Add**.

      - **My LDAP groups**: Select user groups from the available directory groups and click **Add**.

      - **My address groups**: Select address groups from the available address groups and click **Add**.

      - **Type address or domain**: Type a specific domain or wildcard address and click **Add**.

2.  In the **Senders** section, choose one of the following ways to specify sender addresses:

    - **Anyone**: Select it to apply any sender addresses for the policy rule.

    - **My organization**: Select it to apply email addresses sent from your organization for the policy rule.

    - **Specify**:

      - **My domains**: Select domains from the available domains and click **Add**.

      - **My address groups**: Select address groups from the available address groups and click **Add**.

      - **Type address or domain**: Type a specific domain or wildcard address and click **Add**.

3.  In the **Exceptions** section, specify one or multiple exceptions, each of which consists of a sender part and a recipient part.

    1.  Next to **Sender**, choose one of the following ways to specify the sender part of an exception:

        - **Anyone**

        - **My organization**

        - **My domains**

        - **My address groups**

        - **Type address or domain**

    2.  Next to **Recipient**, choose one of the following ways to specify the recipient part of an exception:

        - **Anyone**

        - **My organization**

        - **My domains**

        - **My LDAP groups**

        - **My address groups**

        - **Type address or domain**

    3.  Click **Add** to add an exception composed of both the sender and recipient parts.

        The exception you added appears in the exception list.

        For example, if you select **Anyone** for the sender part and specify a specific email address for the recipient part, Cloud Email Gateway Protection considers email messages sent from any senders to this recipient safe and bypasses the policy rule on these messages.

    4.  Add more exceptions if necessary.

    :::note

    The import and export functions are available for recipients, senders and exception lists. Click **Import** to import groups, addresses or domains from a local file. Click **Export** to export groups, addresses or domains as a local file for future use.

    A maximum of 500 records can be imported, and there is no upper limit for export.

4.  Proceed to the next screen to specify policy rule scanning criteria.
