The **Top Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Incidents** chart on the **Top Statistics** tab of **Dashboard** displays the email addresses that sent or received the most messages triggering DLP incidents regardless of the action taken (block or pass) based on the selected mail traffic direction.

Select a time period by **Date**, **Week**, or **Month** to show data for the selected time period.

The specified time period only affects the data shown on this chart and its corresponding thumbnail chart on the **Threats** tab. Changing these selections does not affect other charts.

Use the **Top violators** drop-down list to select the number of email addresses that display on the chart.
