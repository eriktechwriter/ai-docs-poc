## Set up a Syslog on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 {#set-up-a-syslog-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8}

The following steps describe how to configure rsyslog on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to receive logs from Server & Workload Protection.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Log in as root.

2.  Execute: `vi /etc/rsyslog.conf`

3.  Uncomment the following lines near the top of the `rsyslog.conf` to change them from:

    ``` codeblock
    #module(load="imudp")
    #input(type="imudp" port="514")

    #module(load="imtcp")
    #input(type="imtcp" port="514")
    ```

    to

    ``` codeblock
    module(load="imudp")
    input(type="imudp" port="514")

    module(load="imtcp")
    input(type="imtcp" port="514")
    ```

4.  Add the following two lines of text to the end of the `rsyslog.conf`:

    - `#Save Manager logs to DSM.log`
    - `Local4.* /var/log/DSM.log`

    :::note

    You may need to replace `Local4` with another value, depending on your Server & Workload Protection settings.
    :::

5.  Save the file and exit.

6.  Create the `/var/log/DSM.log` file by typing `touch /var/log/DSM.log`.

7.  Set the permissions on the DSM log so that syslog can write to it.

8.  Save the file and exit.

9.  Restart syslog: `systemctl restart rsyslog`

### Next steps {#next-steps}

## Set up a Syslog on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7 {#set-up-a-syslog-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-6-or-7}

The following steps describe how to configure rsyslog on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7 to receive logs from Server & Workload Protection.

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Log in as root.

2.  Execute: `vi /etc/rsyslog.conf`

3.  Uncomment the following lines near the top of the `rsyslog.conf` to change them from:

    ``` codeblock
    #$ModLoad imudp
    #$UDPServerRun 514

    #$ModLoad imtcp
    #$InputTCPServerRun 514
    ```

    to

    ``` codeblock
    $ModLoad imudp
    $UDPServerRun 514

    $ModLoad imtcp
    $InputTCPServerRun 514
    ```

4.  Add the following two lines of text to the end of the `rsyslog.conf`:

    - `#Save Manager logs to DSM.log`
    - `Local4.* /var/log/DSM.log`

    :::note

    You may need to replace `Local4` with another value, depending on your Server & Workload Protection settings.
    :::

5.  Save the file and exit.

6.  Create the `/var/log/DSM.log` file by typing `touch /var/log/DSM.log`.

7.  Set the permissions on the DSM log so that syslog can write to it.

8.  Save the file and exit.

9.  Restart syslog:

    - On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6: `service rsyslog restart`
    - On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7: `systemctl restart rsyslog`

### Next steps {#next-steps-1}

When Syslog is functioning you will see logs populated in: `/var/log/DSM.log`

## Set up a Syslog on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 {#set-up-a-syslog-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-5}

The following steps describe how to configure Syslog on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to receive logs from Server & Workload Protection.

### Procedure {#procedure-2}

1.  Log in as root.

2.  Execute: `vi /etc/syslog.conf`

3.  Add the following two lines of text to the end of the `syslog.conf`:

    - `#Save Manager logs to DSM.log`
    - `Local4.* /var/log/DSM.log`

    :::note

4.  Save the file and exit.

5.  Create the `/var/log/DSM.log` file by typing `touch /var/log/DSM.log`.

6.  Set the permissions on the DSM log so that syslog can write to it.

7.  Execute: `vi /etc/sysconfig/syslog`

8.  Modify the line " `SYSLOGD_OPTIONS` " and add a " `-r` " to the options.

9.  Save the file and exit.

10. Restart syslog: `/etc/init.d/syslog restart`

### Next steps {#next-steps-2}

When Syslog is functioning you will see logs populated in: `/var/log/DSM.log`
