### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Outbound Protection → Domain-based Authentication → Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) Monitoring**.

2.  Go to **DMARC Record Check**.

3.  Generate a DMARC record for a domain.

    - For a domain with DMARC disabled, click **Disabled** in the **DMARC** column and then click **Create** on the **DMARC Record in DNS** screen to generate a DMARC record.

    - For a domain with DMARC enabled, click **Enabled** in the **DMARC** column and then click **Modify** on the **DMARC Record in DNS** screen to update the DMARC record options and generate a new record.

4.  On the **Generate DMARC Record** screen, specify the basic options.

    :::note

    If you leave an option empty, the corresponding tag does not appear in the resulting DMARC record.

5.  Optionally specify the advanced options.

6.  Click **Generate**.

    Cloud Email Gateway Protection generates a DMARC record based on your settings. You can copy the record and publish it to the DNS server.

    Example record: `v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc-fail-reports@example.com; adkim=s; aspf=r; ri=86400; fo=0; rf=afrf; pct=50`

    - `v=DMARC1`: This is version 1 of the DMARC specification.

      This tag is automatically added during the record generation.

    - `p=none`: The policy for the primary domain is none, which indicates only monitoring messages from the domain for DMARC authentication.

    - `sp=quarantine`: The policy for subdomains is quarantine, which indicates that you expect the receiving server to treat the messages from the subdomains of the primary domain as suspicious.

    - `rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com`: The email address for receiving aggregate reports is dmarc-reports@example.com.

    - `ruf=mailto:dmarc-fail-reports@example.com`: The email address for receiving aggregate reports is dmarc-fail-reports@example.com.

    - `adkim=s`: The DKIM alignment policy is to apply strict DKIM alignment checks.

    - `aspf=r`: The SPF alignment policy is to apply relaxed SPF alignment checks.

    - `ri=86400`: The interval for sending reports is 86400 seconds.

    - `fo=0`: The condition for sending forensic reports is only when both SPF and DKIM fail.

    - `rf=afrf`: The format for sending forensic reports is AFRF.

    - `pct=50`: The policy will be applied to 50% of the messages.
