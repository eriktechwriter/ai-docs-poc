The **Threat Details** chart on the **Threats** tab of **Dashboard** displays the number of messages detected as threats and the total percentage of blocked messages.

The **Threat Details** table allows you to drill down from overall metrics into policy event logs for more granular data. The drill-down actions are available only for threats detected within the past 30 days.

Select a time period by **Date**, **Week**, **Month**, or **Last 12 months** to show data for the selected time period.

The specified time period only affects the data shown on this chart and its corresponding thumbnail chart on the **Threats** tab. Changing these selections does not affect other charts.

The following is the specific data displayed:
