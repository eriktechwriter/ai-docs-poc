Use Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection to scan for and detect vulnerabilities and malware in your cloud environment.

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection is a serverless function enabled in your connected cloud accounts. The function scans supported cloud resources for vulnerabilities and malware without impact to other resources or running applications. The function only activates during a scan and scales dynamically to meet the needs of the scanning process within a set resource limit. All collected data is analyzed within the serverless function, and only metadata is sent to Trend Vision One. Your data does not leave your cloud account.

:::warning[Important]

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection takes snapshots of your cloud storage resources prior to scanning and tags the snapshots with the tag `trend-micro-product:avtd`. Use the tag to identify snapshots waiting to be scanned and to exclude the snapshots from any automated deletion processes you have configured. Snapshots are automatically deleted from your cloud account after the scan completes.
:::

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection currently supports the following cloud providers:

- [AWS](get-start-agentless-vulnerbaility.mdx)

- [Google Cloud](get-started-google-cloud.mdx)

- [Microsoft Azure](get-started-azure.mdx)

Vulnerability scanning inspects your cloud resources for known CVEs. Anti-malware scanning scans your cloud resources to identify potential malware, including viruses, Trojans, spyware, and more. Scans occur once per day, starting when you first connect your cloud account and enable the feature. Scan times are not configurable after deployment.

:::note

Anti-malware scanning is not enabled for AWS accounts by default. After enabling the feature, anti-malware scans begin during the next daily scan.
:::

Scan results are sent to Trend Vision One for review. If results contain vulnerabilities or malware, suggested remediation options are displayed for the associated risk event in **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Threat and Exposure Management**.

The following table lists the cloud provider resources that Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection supports.

Vulnerability detections are available in the following locations in the Trend Vision One console:

- **Cloud Risk Management → Cloud Security Posture**

- **Cyber Risk Overview → Risk Overview → Cloud Assets → Risk Factors**

- **Cyber Risk Overview → Exposure Overview → Vulnerabilities**

- **Threat and Exposure Management → Risk Reduction Measures**

- **Threat and Exposure Management → All Risk Events**

- **Threat and Exposure Management → Vulnerabilities**

- Cloud asset profile screens in **Attack Surface Discovery → Cloud Assets → Cloud Asset List**

When viewing vulnerability detections, expand the associated risk event on the list to see available remediation or mitigation options and metadata associated with the detection. Use the provided metadata to execute a query in [XDR Data Explorer](search-app.mdx) and learn more about the detection.

Once remediated or mitigated, risk events associated with most cloud resource vulnerability detections no longer appear in **Cyber Risk Exposure Management** after the next daily scan. Vulnerabilities in container images remain visible in **Threat and Exposure Management → Vulnerabilities** for seven days after patching.

Malware detections are available in the following locations in the Trend Vision One console:

- **Cloud Risk Management → Cloud Security Posture**

- **Threat and Exposure Management → All Risk Events**

- **Threat and Exposure Management → Risk Reduction Measures**

- **Threat and Exposure Management → Threat Detection**

- Cloud asset profile screens in **Attack Surface Discovery → Cloud Assets → Cloud Asset List**

When viewing malware detections, expand the associated risk event to see metadata associated with the detection. Use the metadata to execute queries in [XDR Data Explorer](search-app.mdx) and further investigate the threat. To learn about available remediation options, click **View options** under the risk event.

:::tip

When executing queries in **XDR Data Explorer**, you may search for the partition containing the malware using the file system universal unique identifier (UUID). If the file system UUID is not available in the detection metadata, you can [find the UUID](find-file-system-uuid.mdx) using CLI commands.
:::

Once remediated, risk events associated with most cloud resource malware detections no longer appear in **Cyber Risk Exposure Management** after the next daily anti-malware scan. Malware detections in container images remain in **Threat and Exposure Management → All Risk Events** for seven days after remediation.
