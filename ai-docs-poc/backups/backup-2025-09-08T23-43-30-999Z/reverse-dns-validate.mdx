Cloud Email Gateway Protection allows you to add reverse DNS validation for sender domains.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Inbound Protection → Connection Filtering → Reverse DNS Validation**.

2.  Click the **Settings** tab, and click **Add** to configure reverse DNS validation rules for sender domains.

    Two rules are pre-configured:

    - Default (for unspecified domains): applies to all sender domains, except those for which you have configured a new reverse DNS validation rule.

    - Empty sender: applies to email messages with no envelope address specified.

3.  On the **Add Reverse DNS Validation Settings** screen, specify a sender domain in one of the following formats:

    - example.com

    - subdomain.example.com

    - \*.example.com

      This format matches all the subdomains under the example.com domain, for example, a.example.com, a.b.example.com.

4.  Select **Reject for missing PTR** and/or **Reject for invalid PTR**.

    - **Reject for missing PTR**: Reject a message when its sending IP address has no PTR record.

    - **Reject for invalid PTR**: Reject a message when its sending IP address has a PTR record, but for the PTR record, there is no mapping A record, or the IP address in the A record does not match the sending IP address.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The reverse DNS validation rule appears in the list on the **Settings** tab.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

To remove a rule, select a rule and click **Delete**. You can also select the checkbox in the table heading row to select all rules except the default rule and **Empty sender** rule, which you cannot delete.
