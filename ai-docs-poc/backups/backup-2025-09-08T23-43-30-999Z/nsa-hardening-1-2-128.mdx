Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Restrict kubelet nodes to reading only objects associated with them.

The `Node` authorization mode only allows kubelets to read `Secret`, `ConfigMap`, `PersistentVolume`, and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects associated with their nodes.

:::note

By default, `Node` authorization is not enabled.
:::

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include `Node`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `Node`.

``` codeblock
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
```
