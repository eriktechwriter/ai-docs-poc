View and understand the meaning of trust attributes applied to trust relationships in Active Directory (on-premises).

Trust attributes in Active Directory (on-premises) define the limitations of a trust relationship between domains in Active Directory (on-premises). Understanding the trust attributes for a domain can help you when trying to restrict or allow access to certain domains.

The following table lists the trust attributes available for trust relationships in the **Trust relationships** tab of Identity Inventory for Active Directory (on-premises).
