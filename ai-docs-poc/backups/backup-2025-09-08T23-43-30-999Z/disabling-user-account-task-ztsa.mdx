You can take remediation measures on user accounts that may pose a security risk to your network environment on the Trend Vision One console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Locate the user account that you want to take action on using the **Zero Trust Secure Access** or **Threat and Exposure Management** app.

    - **Zero Trust Secure Access**: Go to the **User Information** screen by clicking on a user anywhere within the **Zero Trust Secure Access** app.

    - **Threat and Exposure Management**: Go to the **User Profile** screen.

2.  Click the options icon (![](/images/options_icon=1b2aff71-0b33-4aa1-b8aa-6105438834e7.webp)) and **Disable User Account**.

    The **Disable User Account Task** screen appears.

3.  (Optional) Specify a description for the task.

4.  Click **Create**.

    Trend Vision One creates the task and displays the current action status on the **Secure Access History** screen.

5.  (Optional) Grant required permissions on the IAM system that manages the user account.

    :::note

    This step is required only when the policy enforcement permission is not granted and the task fails due to insufficient permissions. For more information, see [Supported IAM systems and required permissions](iam-systems-required-permissions.mdx).
    :::

    1.  Go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Rules → IAM System Settings**.

    2.  On the **IAM System Settings** screen that appears, grant the policy enforcement permission on the desired IAM system to authorize Trend Vision One to access user data and enforce user access actions on your IAM system.

    3.  Locate the user account and take the action again.

        Trend Vision One creates the task and displays the current action status on the **Secure Access History** screen.

6.  Monitor the task status.

    1.  Click **View task status** in the success message that pops up in the lower right corner.

        The **Remediation Logs** tab on the **Secure Access History** screen appears.

        You can also go directly to **Secure Access History → Remediation Logs**, and locate the task using the search field.

    2.  View the task status under **Action status**.

        - *In progress...* (![](/images/inProgress=763d5319-3680-4b10-abca-a75782d8eb48.webp)): Trend Vision One sent the command to the enforcement point and is waiting for a response

        - *Successful* (![](/images/successful=d385863c-ae1f-4a76-8500-6d60d7a2de8f.webp)): The enforcement point successfully received and executed the command

        - *Unsuccessful* (![](/images/unsuccessful=e4c3ece6-3776-45dc-b99a-67195d7d21e0.webp)): An error or time-out occurred when attempting to send the command to the enforcement point

        :::note

        The task status indicates whether the enforcement point was able to successfully receive and execute the command. It may take a few minutes for the process to complete.
        :::

    After resolving the risk issues on the disabled user account, you can enable the user account using the options icon (![](/images/options_icon=1b2aff71-0b33-4aa1-b8aa-6105438834e7.webp)) in the **Zero Trust Secure Access** or **Threat and Exposure Management** app.
