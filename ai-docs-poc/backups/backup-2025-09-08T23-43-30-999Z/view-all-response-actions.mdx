December 17, 2024—If the action taken on a playbook target is In progress, Successful, or Unsuccessful, you can click **View All Actions on the Target** in **Action Details** to view a comprehensive list of all response actions on the target within the Response Management app. This enhancement enables more accurate and timely decision-making, such as revoking an action (if applicable).

For more information, see [Action details](action-details.mdx).
