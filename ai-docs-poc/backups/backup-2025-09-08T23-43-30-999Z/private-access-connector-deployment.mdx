Deploy one or multiple Private Access Connectors to the supported platforms.

Private Access Connectors connect your cloud-based and locally-installed applications with Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access, which allows you to control access to sensitive corporate resources. To ensure high availability (HA) and facilitate load-balancing on high traffic apps, install and group together at least 2 connectors in each environment. Before attempting to deploy the Private Access Connector, ensure that your environment meets the minimum [system requirements](pa-connector-system-reqs.mdx).

:::note

A deployment guide appears the first time you access the **Private Access Configuration** app to help you set up the service.
