December 6, 2024—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection conducts a performance check on custom expressions for Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to ensure that they have suitable matching performance. When administrators create and save an expression, the back-end conducts a performance check. Based on the results, the system either confirms that the expression can be saved successfully or displays a warning advising the administrator to review and update the expression before saving again.
