Connect your Trend Micro security products to enhance visibility of your environment from the Trend Vision One console.

Depending on the connection type, you can connect existing products to Trend Vision One automatically or by using an enrollment token. Some products require additional settings to ensure optimal performance. See the links in the table below for more information on each product.

:::warning[Important]

If the product instance you want to connect was previously connected to another Trend Vision One instance, you must disconnect the product from the other Trend Vision One console before connecting to your current console through Product Instance.
