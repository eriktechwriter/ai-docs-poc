Each scan initiated against a registry image using the Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) generates a new temporary directory under $TMPDIR to download and analyze the image.

For version 1.35.0 and later, this tool automatically removes those temporary files after scan execution.

To clean up existing temporary files that were generated with prior versions or by an interrupted scan, use the following commands (or its platform equivalent) under your discretion:

``` codeblock
echo $TMPDIR
ls $TMPDIR | grep "stereoscope-"
cd $TMPDIR && rm -rf ./stereoscope-*
ls $TMPDIR | grep "stereoscope-"
```
