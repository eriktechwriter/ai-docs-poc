For a detailed explanation of agent updates, see [Update Settings](update-settings.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Agents download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server when unable to connect to the Apex One (Mac) server** to allow agents to download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.

    :::note

    If a Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent only has an IPv6 address, read the IPv6 limitations for agent updates in [Pure IPv6 Agent Limitations](pure-ipv6-agent-limitations.mdx).
    :::

2.  Select **Agents can update the components but not upgrade the agent program or install hot fixes** to allow component updates to proceed but prevents agent upgrade.

3.  To set up scheduled updates, complete the following steps:

    1.  Select **Enable scheduled update**.

    2.  Configure the schedule.

    3.  If you select **Daily** or **Weekly**, specify the time of the update and the time period the Apex One (Mac) server will notify Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents to update components. For example, if the start time is 12pm and the time period is 2 hours, the server randomly notifies all online Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents to update components from 12pm until 2pm. This setting prevents all online Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents from simultaneously connecting to the server at the specified start time, significantly reducing the amount of traffic directed to the server.
