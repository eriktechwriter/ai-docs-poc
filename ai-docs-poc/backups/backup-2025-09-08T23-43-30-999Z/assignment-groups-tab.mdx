<tr>
<td><p>Assignment group</p></td>
<td><p>The assignment group name</p>
<p>Assignment groups are created to manage enrolled users and devices that security policies and compliance policies can be assigned to. Assignment groups can contain the user groups synchronized from your Microsoft Entra ID.</p>
<p>The built-in assignment group "All devices" contains all devices managed by the organization.</p></td>

<td><p>Membership type</p></td>
<td><p>The type of assignment group membership</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Entra ID groups</strong></p>
<p>You manually assign Microsoft Entra ID groups to this assignment group and manually remove the Microsoft Entra ID groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Selected devices</strong></p>
<p>You manually assign your organization's devices to this assignment group and manually remove the devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic devices</strong></p>
<p>You create dynamic membership criteria to automatically add and remove devices. Dynamic group membership adds and removes group members automatically using membership criteria based on member attributes. When the attributes of a device change, the system evaluates all dynamic group criteria to see if the change would trigger any group adds or removes. If a device satisfies the criteria on a group, they are added as a member of that group. If they no longer satisfy the criteria, they are removed. You cannot manually add or remove a member of a dynamic group.</p></li>
