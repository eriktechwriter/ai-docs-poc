September 27, 2023—Endpoint Sensor now supports a wider range of Linux platforms including Debian and SUSE, as well as several AArch64-based Linux systems such as Ubuntu 22. You can now view these additional platforms when deploying a new Trend Vision One agent in the Endpoint Inventory app.

For details on supported Linux platforms, see [Endpoint Sensor-only system requirements](es-agent-sys-reqs.mdx) and [Server & Workload Protection system requirements](swp-agent-sys-requirements.mdx).
