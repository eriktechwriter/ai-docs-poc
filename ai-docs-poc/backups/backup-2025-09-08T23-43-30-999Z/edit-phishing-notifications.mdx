Add images, including logos and informative content, to your phishing simulation notification templates.

When you create a phishing simulation, you may specify the types of notifications users receive based on the user's actions during the simulation. Templates for notifications are available for:

- Users who clicked links in the simulation email

- Users who entered data in the simulation landing page

- Users who performed any non-recommended action during the simulation

Templates are also available for situations in which you want phished users to enroll in follow-up training campaigns. You can modify the notification templates to suit your organization's needs by adding placeholders, editing text, and adding images.

:::warning[Important]

Some entities, including government and financial organizations, are sensitive to the use of their logos in content related to phishing simulations. Trend Micro is not responsible for any issues that may arise if you upload and use trademarked images in your phishing simulation content. Encourage employees to report suspicious emails to your IT or information security team for investigation before reporting the emails to a trademark owner.
