:::::: {role="main"}
Profile applicability: Level 1

Enable kubelet client certificate rotation.

:::note

See the Amazon EKS documentation for the default value.
:::

The `--rotate-certificates` setting causes the kubelet to rotate its client certificates by creating new CSRs as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there is no downtime due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) security triad.

:::note

This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to implement rotation yourself.
:::

:::note

This feature also requires the `RotateKubeletClientCertificate` feature gate.

### Audit {#audit}

1.  SSH to each node and run the following command to find the Kubelet process:

    ``` codeblock
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

2.  If the output of the command above includes the `--RotateCertificate` executable argument, verify that it is set to `true`.

3.  If the output of the command above does not include the `--RotateCertificate` executable argument, then check the Kubelet config file. The output of the above command should return something similar to `--config /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json`, which is the location of the Kubelet config file.

4.  Open the Kubelet config file:

    ``` codeblock
    cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json
    ```

5.  Verify that the `RotateCertificate` argument is not present, or is set to `true`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

**Remediation Method 1**

If modifying the Kubelet config file, edit the kubelet-config.json file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` and set the below parameter to `true`:

``` codeblock
"RotateCertificate":true
```

Additionally, ensure that the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf` does not set the `--RotateCertificate` executable argument to `false` because this would override the Kubelet config file.

**Remediation Method 2**

If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf` on each worker node, and add the below parameter at the end of the `KUBELET_ARGS` variable string:

``` codeblock
--RotateCertificate=true
```
