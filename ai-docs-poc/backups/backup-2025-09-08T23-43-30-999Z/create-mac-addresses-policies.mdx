:::: {role="main"}
Create lists of MAC addresses so that you can use them in multiple policies. A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each created in a different policy.

:::tip

To create a MAC list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it.
:::

MAC lists support MAC addresses in both hyphen- and colon-separated formats, for example 0A-0F-FF-F0-A0-AF and 0A:0F:FF:F0:A0:AF. You can insert comments into your MAC list by preceding the text with a pound sign ("#").

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Click **Policies → Common Objects → Lists → MAC Lists**.

2.  Click **New → New MAC List**.

3.  Type a name and, optionally, a description.

4.  In the *MAC(s)* list, add the MAC addresses, one per line.

5.  Click *OK*.
