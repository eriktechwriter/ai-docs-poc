Modify a risk control rule in classic view.

When a user or device matches the criteria in a risk control rule, based on the actions configured, Trend Vision One monitors the user or device's subsequent activity and takes action when the monitored activity occurs. For example, when a user with a persistent high risk score attempts to sign in to a new browser session or access an internal app of your organization the action could be blocked.

:::note

Some risk control rules types can be modified in classic view. New risk control rules must be created in [playbook view](risk-control-rule-playbook.mdx).
:::
