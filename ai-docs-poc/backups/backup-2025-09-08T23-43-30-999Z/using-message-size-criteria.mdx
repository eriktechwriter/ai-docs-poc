### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Scanning Criteria** tab, click **Advanced**.

2.  Select **Message size is** in the criteria list.

3.  Select **\>** or **\<=** from the comparison drop-down list.

    - Select **\>** to apply the policy rule to messages that are larger than the specified size.

    - Select **\<=** to apply the policy rule to messages that are smaller than or equal to the specified size.

    For example, **\<= 10 MB** applies the policy rule to all messages that are smaller than or equal to 10 megabytes.

4.  Type a number for the size.

5.  Select a unit of measurement from the following choices:

    - **KB**: Kilobytes

    - **MB**: Megabytes

    :::note

    The **Message size is** criteria is applied to the total size of a message, including any attachments it might contain.
    :::

    For example, if a message contained two attachments, one a 3 MB attachment and the other a 1 MB attachment, a policy rule that deletes messages over 2 MB would delete the entire message, including both attachments.
