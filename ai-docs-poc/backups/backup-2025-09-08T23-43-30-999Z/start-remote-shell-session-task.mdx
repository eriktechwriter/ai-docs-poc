::: {role="main"}
Directly access an endpoint and execute CLI commands or a custom script file during an investigation.

This task is supported by the following services:

- Trend Vision One

  - macOS agent

  - Linux agent

  :::note

  For Windows, use [the new remote access feature](remote-access-session-task.mdx).
  :::

- Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security

  - Windows agent

  - macOS agent

  - Linux agent

Only users with the Master Administrator or Security Analyst roles can access the remote access session response.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  After identifying the endpoint to investigate, access the context or response menu and click **Start Remote Access Session**.

    The **Remote Access** screen appears and Trend Vision One attempts to connect to the endpoint.

    :::note

    Trend Vision One only permits 10 concurrent remote access sessions per company and does not allow multiple to access the same endpoint concurrently. The target endpoint must be online in order to connect successfully.

    If Trend Vision One cannot establish a session within five minutes, the connection times out.
    :::

2.  Use the CLI to manually type commands or run an existing custom script file.

    - Use the Remote Acccess console to execute the necessary commands for your investigation.

      Type `help` at any time to view all the commands available.

      - [Remote Shell Commands for Linux Endpoints](remote-shell-linux-endpoints.mdx)

      - [Remote Shell Commands for Mac Endpoints](remote-shell-mac-endpoints.mdx)

      :::note

      A session automatically ends after two hours and automatically times out after 10 minutes of inactivity.
      :::

    - Click **Use Custom Script** to open the details panel and click **Run** next to the script file that you want to execute.

      :::note

      Trend Vision One only permits you to one custom script file per session. The target endpoint must be online to connect successfully.
      :::

3.  After you have completed your investigation, click **End Session** to terminate the connection to the endpoint.

4.  Provide a description for the remote access session then click **End Session**.

    :::note

    Terminating the connection may take a minute to complete. If you close the browser window before clicking **End Session**, the connection to the endpoint times out after 10 minutes.
