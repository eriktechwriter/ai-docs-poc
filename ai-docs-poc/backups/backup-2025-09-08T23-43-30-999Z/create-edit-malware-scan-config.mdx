Create or edit a malware scan configuration to control the behavior of a real-time, manual, or scheduled scan. (For more information, see [Malware scan configurations](anti-malware.mdx).) You can create multiple malware scan configurations as required.

- After you create a malware scan configuration, you can then associate it with a scan in a policy or computer (see [Select the types of scans to perform](enable-configure-anti-malware.mdx))

- When you edit a malware scan configuration that a policy or computer is using, the changes affect the scans that are associated with the configuration.

:::tip

To create a malware scan configuration that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the existing configuration and then edit it.
:::

You can create two types of malware scan configurations according to the type of scan it controls (see [Types of malware scans](anti-malware.mdx)):

- **Real-time scan configuration**: Controls real-time scans. Some actions such as **s** are only available to real-time scan configurations.

- **Manual/scheduled scan configuration**: Controls either manual or scheduled scans. Some options such as **CPU Usage** are only available to manual/scheduled scan configurations.

Server & Workload Protection provides a default malware scan configuration for each type of scan.

:::tip

To see the policies and computers that are using a malware scan configuration, see the AssignedTo tab of the properties.
