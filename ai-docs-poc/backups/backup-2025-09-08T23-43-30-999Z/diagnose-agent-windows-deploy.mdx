### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Log in to the computer where you were trying to install the agent.

2.  Go to `%appdata%\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent\installer`.

3.  Examine:

    - *dsa_deploy.txt* - Log from the PowerShell script. Contains agent activation issues.

    - *dsa_install.txt* - Log from the MSI installer. Contains agent installation issues.
