June 2, 2025—XDR for Cloud is now available with hourly pay-as-you-go billing via AWS Marketplace. You can now choose between allocating credits and using consumption-based pay-as-you-go billing for your XDR for Cloud usage.

To get started with pay-as-you-go, purchase a Trend Vision One pay-as-you-go contract on AWS Marketplace. For existing subscribers, you can simply switch between billing models for XDR for Cloud in Credits & Billing.
