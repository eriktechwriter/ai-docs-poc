The policy list displays the information and status of policies created by all users. When a new endpoint registers to Trend Micro Apex Central, it goes through the filtered policies in the list in descending order. Trend Micro Apex Central assigns the new endpoint to a filtered policy when the following conditions are both satisfied:

- The new endpoint matches the target criteria of the policy

- The policy creator has the permission to manage the new endpoint

The following table describes the policy list columns that display on the **Policy Management** screen. Click a column to sort the data.

<td><p>This column only appears if the selected product is <strong>Apex One Security Agent</strong>.</p>
<p>If a policy is a child policy, this column shows the number of settings that have been changed on the policy and are therefore inconsistent with settings on the parent policy. If settings are consistent between the policy and its parent, 0 (zero) displays.</p>

:::note

<p>The default owner is the user who created the policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you change the owner of a policy to a user account that does not have access rights to the specified targets, the new owner can modify the policy settings but cannot view the policy data.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also assign multiple owners by assigning the policy to an Active Directory group.</p></li>
