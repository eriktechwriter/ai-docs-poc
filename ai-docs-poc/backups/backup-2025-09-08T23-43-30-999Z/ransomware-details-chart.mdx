The **Ransomware Details** chart on the **Threats** tab of **Dashboard** displays the number of messages detected as ransomware by different components of Cloud Email Gateway Protection.

Hover over **Malware Scanning** detections above the chart to view the number of threats detected by Predictive Machine Learning and the number of threats detected by pattern-based scanning.

Select a time period by **Date**, **Week**, **Month**, or **Last 12 months** to show data for the selected time period.

The specified time period only affects the data shown on this chart and its corresponding thumbnail chart on the **Threats** tab. Changing these selections does not affect other charts.
