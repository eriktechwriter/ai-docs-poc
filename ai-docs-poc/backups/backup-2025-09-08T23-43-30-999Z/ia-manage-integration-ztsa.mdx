Integrate a supported IAM system with Zero Trust Secure Access and grant the required permissions.

Zero Trust Secure Access supports the following IAM systems:

- [Microsoft Entra ID](ztsa-integration-sso.mdx)

- [Okta](ztsa-okta-integration-sso.mdx)

- [Active Directory (on-premises)](ad-onprem-ztsa.mdx)

- [OpenLDAP](openldap-integration-sso-ztsa.mdx)

- [Google Cloud Identity](gcp-integrat-sso-ztsa.mdx)

You must grant certain permissions within your IAM system to enable Zero Trust Secure Access to monitor user sign-in attempts, access user data, and perform actions on user accounts. To enable user authentication for Private Access and Internet Access, you must configure SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) for your IAM system.

:::note

- Zero Trust Secure Access only supports SSO for one IAM system at a time.

- Internet Access also supports NTLM v2-based SSO for your on-premises Active Directory.

- To ensure web access from public or home networks for users without the Secure Access Module, you must verify your authentication domain in [Domain Verification](domain-verification.mdx). Domain verification is unnecessary when using NTLM v2 or Kerberos-based authentication.
