April 21, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection now offers enhanced management capabilities for third-party phishing simulation integrations. Administrators can manage approved service providers and their corresponding sending IP addresses directly through the administrator console, allowing Cloud Email Gateway Protection to bypass scans for phishing simulation emails from approved third-party service providers.

Additionally, this feature now supports phishing simulation integration for the Japan site.
