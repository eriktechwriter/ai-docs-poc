Quarantine Digest is only available for *inbound* email messages that have been assigned "View" permissions on the **End User Quarantine Settings** screen.
:::

A quarantine digest notification is an email message Cloud Email Gateway Protection sends to inform end users of email messages that were temporarily quarantined. The digest notification lists up to 100 of each end user's quarantined messages.

You can customize digest rules and templates on the **Digest Settings** screen. A digest notification contains the following information:

- A link to access quarantined messages through the End User Console

- The number of new email messages that have been quarantined since the last notification was sent

- Digest of the new email messages that have been quarantined

  - Quarantined: The time an email message was quarantined

  - Sender: The sender address of the email message

  - Recipient: The recipient address of the email message

  - Subject: The email subject

  - Manage Messages: The links that users can click to apply actions to the quarantined message, including **Deliver**, **Deliver & Approve Sender**, **Block Sender**, **Approve Sender Domain**, **Block Sender Domain**, and **Preview**.

    When the **Preview** action is selected, Cloud Email Gateway Protection includes a preview link for each quarantined email in a digest notification. This enables end users to view the summary and details of a quarantined email and take inline actions directly from the preview page. End users can switch between viewing the plain text, source code, and rendered HTML of the email body content by clicking the **Plain Text** tab or the **Show Source** or **Hide Source** buttons to on the **HTML** tab. Additionally, end users can click **Render Image** or **Hide Image** to display or hide the images within the body content.

    Different quarantined messages in a digest notification may have different inline actions. The inline actions available for each quarantined message are determined by the following settings:

    - Quarantined message permissions configured on the **Quarantine → End User Quarantine Settings** screen

      For more information, see [Configuring end user quarantine settings](configuring-euq-settings.mdx).

    - Inline action settings configured in the digest notification template

      For more information, see [Adding or editing a digest template](adding-or-editing-digest-template.mdx).

    End users are required to confirm their operations on a dedicated page to prevent unexpected access during the digest notification transmission.

    :::danger[Warning]

    Inline action links display only when you enable **Inline actions** in the digest template.

    Once inline actions are enabled, anyone receiving the digest notification can take the actions on quarantined messages. Therefore, administrators must warn digest recipients not to forward the digest notification.

If an end user account manages multiple accounts, Cloud Email Gateway Protection sends digest notifications for the managed accounts as described in the following table.
