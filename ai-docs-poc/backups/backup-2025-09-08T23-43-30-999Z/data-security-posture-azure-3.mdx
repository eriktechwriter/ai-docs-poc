Enable Data Security Posture to discover and classify sensitive data in your Azure subscriptions, and predict potential attack paths for data leakage due to misconfiguration and vulnerability. .

You can enable Data Security Posture on both new and existing Azure subscriptions in **Cloud Accounts**. For more information on Data Security Posture, see [Data Security Posture](data-posture.mdx).

:::note

Data Security Posture scanning is limited to files in blob containers within the following storage account types:

- Standard general-purpose v2

- Premium block blobs

- Legacy blob storage
:::

For more information on storage account types, see the [Azure Blob Storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Enable Data Security Posture on a new or existing Azure subscription:

    1.  Go to **Cloud Security â†’ Cloud Accounts**.

    2.  Click the Azure tab.

    3.  Click **Add Subscription** or select an Azure subscription from the list.

    4.  On the Features and Permissions page (if you are adding a new subscription), or the Resource Update tab (if you are configuring an existing subscription), enable **Data Security Posture**.

    5.  By default Data Security Posture deploys to all regions. To remove regions, click the **Deployment** list and clear the checkbox beside each region you want to remove.

2.  In Azure Cloud Shell, access the command line interface.

    :::note

    The **Add Azure Subscription** screen in the Trend Vision One console provides a set of commands to help complete the following steps. To complete the connection process, you must copy each command provided in the screen to enable the **Done** button. While you can alter some parameters, Trend Micro recommends using the commands as provided to prevent the deployment failing.

3.  Create a new directory for the deployment folder and then access the folder.

    Copy the command or type `mkdir[Subscription ID] && cd [Subscription ID]`.

    :::note

    The commands provided by Trend Vision One use your subscription ID as the directory name. While you can specify any directory name you want, you must ensure the folder has a unique name and that there are no other Terraform files in the deployment folder.
    :::

4.  Upload the resource creation script to your Azure Cloud Shell.

    - To use a command to upload the template directly to Cloud Shell, select **Curl Command**.

      Copy and paste the **Curl Command** into Cloud Shell to retrieve the template package. The command is dynamically generated based on your account and region.

    - To download the template first and upload from your local machine, select **Manual**.

      Click **Download the Terraform Template** to save the template to your local machine. Make sure your Cloud Shell environment is set to the same region you selected for the Terraform deployment before uploading the package.

5.  Extract the template using the command in the **Subscription Settings** screen.

    The zip file name contains a randomly-generated number. Copy the command to extract the file: `unzip -o cloud-account-management-terraform-package-[randomly generated number].zip -d cloud-account-management-terraform-package`.

6.  Access the deployment folder.

    Copy the command or type `cd cloud-account-management-terraform-package`.

7.  Run the deployment script.

    Copy the command or type `./deploy.sh`. Azure Cloud Shell begins the Terraform process to deploy Trend Vision One security resources.

8.  In the Trend Vision One console, in the **Connect Azure Subscription** screen, click **Done**.

    :::note

    If the **Done** button is not enabled, make sure you have copied the command line for each step on the screen.
