Use this option if you have a properly-formatted `.xml` file containing the expressions. You can generate the file by exporting the expressions from the Trend Vision One administrator console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Data Identifiers**.

2.  Click the **Expression** tab.

3.  Click **Import** and then locate the `.xml` file containing the expressions.

4.  Click **Open**.

    A message appears, informing you if the import was successful.

    :::note

    Every customized expression is identified by its *name* field in the `.xml` file. This name is a unique internal name that does not display on the administrator console.

    If the file contains a customized expression that already exists, the existing expression is overwritten. If the file contains any predefined expression, the predefined expression is skipped during the import of the remaining customized expressions.
