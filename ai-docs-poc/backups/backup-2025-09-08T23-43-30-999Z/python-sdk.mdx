:::: {role="main"}
The Server & Workload Protection Python SDK consists of a package containing the module that you can use to interact with the API. If you would rather use the API directly via tools such as Postman and curl, you do not need an SDK.

## Prepare to use the Python SDK {#prepare-to-use-the-python-sdk}

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.4 or 3.7

  The Python executable must be in your system path. For Windows, in the Python installer, select *Add Python 3. to PATH* at the start of the installation. For Linux, Python is added to the system path during Python installation.

- pip package manager

  For Windows, pip is installed with Python. For Linux, pip is installed separately from Python. You can install pip using the package manager of your Linux distribution.

## Download and install the Python SDK {#download-and-install-the-python-sdk}

Make sure that you download the [SDK that is compatible with Server & Workload Protection](sdk-version-compatibility.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  [Download SDK](https://ohc.blob.core.windows.net/o-help/manual/74c46ba4-3fda-458c-b397-e7325b4efa5e/c1ws-py-sdk.zip).

2.  Extract the Python SDK ZIP file.

3.  Open a Command Line or Terminal and change the current directory to the directory of the extracted contents.

4.  Enter the following command to install the module and dependencies:

    *Windows*

    `python -m pip install .`

    *Linux and Mac*

    `python3 -m pip install .`

    The preceding commands assume that the Python executable is in your system path.

## Install a Python IDE {#install-a-python-ide}

You can use any Python IDE to develop for the Server & Workload Protection API. If you need to install one, we recommend using PyCharm Community Edition. It is free, well-supported, and has a comprehensive feature set.

## Windows {#windows}

Download [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).

## Linux {#linux}

Follow the [PyCharm installation instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.md?section=Linux) for your Linux distribution.

## Add the SDK to a project in PyCharm {#add-the-sdk-to-a-project-in-pycharm}

You can create a PyCharm project that can run the code examples in the Server & Workload Protection automation guides.

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Run PyCharm.

2.  Click *Create New Project*.

3.  In *Location*, change the folder you wish to save to if needed and then enter a name for the project.

4.  Click *Project Interpreter: New Virtualenv environment*.

5.  Select *Inherit global site-packages*.

6.  Click *Create*.

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

- To get familiar with how to use the SDK with the Server & Workload Protection API, see the [Send Your First Request Using the API](send-your-first-request-using-api.mdx) guide.

- If you are already familiar with using an API or have specific tasks that you want to use the SDK for, see [Run the Code Examples](run-code-examples.mdx) to get started with the task-based examples in other Server & Workload Protection automation guides.

  You can add the code examples from any of the other Server & Workload Protection automation guides to the project you created.
