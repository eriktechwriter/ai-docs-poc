June 9, 2025—Workbench now intelligently surfaces AI-recommended events related to endpoints within an existing insight. These recommendations help you:

- Discover related activity that may not have been initially included in the insight.

- Add relevant events directly to the insight for further correlation.

This feature can give you a more complete and accurate picture of a potential incident and accelerate your investigation by uncovering hidden connections and suspicious activity that might otherwise go unnoticed.
