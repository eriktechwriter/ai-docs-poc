The steps outlined below detail how to grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Exchange Online with an Authorized Account from **Dashboard**. This account enables Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to scan messages after they arrive at or are delivered from protected mailboxes.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Dashboard → Service Status**.

2.  Click **Grant Access** in the **Action** column for Exchange Online.

    The **Grant Access to Exchange Online** screen appears.

3.  Select to synchronize all users and groups or selected users during access grant.

    :::warning[Important]

    For access grant with certain targets synchronized, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection does not support manual synchronization and scheduled synchronization.
    :::

4.  Select the policy to enable automatically when the access grant is complete.

5.  Click **Grant Permission**.

6.  Specify your Microsoft 365 Global Administrator credentials and click **Sign in**.

    The Exchange Online authorization screen appears.

7.  Click **Accept** to grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection permissions to use the Graph API to access all mailboxes.

8.  If you have selected **Synchronize selected users** in step 3, specify the users you want to synchronize.

    1.  In the **Available Targets** area that appears, specify individual users or select users from groups.

        - **By User**: specify the exact user principal name of a user and press **Enter** to verify and display the user name.

        - **By Group**: specify at least the first three characters of the group name and press **Enter** to search for and display the group(s).

    2.  Select the user(s) and click the arrow button to add them to the **Selected Targets** area.

        You can synchronize a maximum of 100 users.

    3.  Optionally select one or multiple users in the **Selected Targets** area and click the arrow button to remove them.

    4.  Click **Submit**.

9.  Wait until the process is completed.

    If the message "Successfully created a service account and synced data." appears on the screen, the access grant is successful.

10. To allow Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to enhance protection for your Exchange Online service based on user behavior, click **Grant Permission** in the banner on the **Dashboard** screen, and follow the instructions to grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection the permission to read activity data for your organization.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

If for some reason the access token becomes invalid, a notification appears on **Dashboard**. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also sends an email message to notify the administrator of this event. To continue using the service account, go to **Administration → Service Account** to create a new access token. For more information, see [Service account](service-account-cloud-apps.mdx).

If only some targets were selected to synchronize during access grant, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection is also able to extend its protection to all targets under the corresponding service by enabling you to manually synchronize all targets:

1.  On the **Service Account** screen, click **Extend Protection to All Targets**.

2.  On the screen that appears, view the instructions and click **Submit**.

3.  Go to **Advanced Threat Protection** or **Data Loss Prevention**, and open an ATP or DLP policy of each service you want to extend the protection to, that is, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, or OneDrive.

4.  Select the **General** tab and click **Click here** to manually synchronize all your targets.

:::note

After clicking **Submit**, you can also wait until the next day because Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection automatically synchronizes with your Microsoft 365 environment once per day.
:::

If only some targets were selected to synchronize during access grant, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection allows you to continue to synchronize new users and remove synchronized users as needed afterward. For more information, see [Managing synchronized user list for Exchange Online](manage-synced-eo-user-list.mdx).
