Connect to your AWS S3 bucket to start sharing XDR data.

:::warning[Important]

Before connecting to an S3 bucket, you must configure a custom role and permissions on the AWS console. For more information, see [Configuring roles for the AWS S3 bucket connector](roles-aws-s3-bucket.mdx)

All AWS S3 buckets require an external ID. To modify an existing configuration, you must [add an external ID to your custom trust policy](roles-aws-s3-bucket.mdx) in the AWS IAM console.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration → AWS S3 Bucket Connector**.

2.  Click **Connect AWS S3 Bucket**.

3.  Configure the settings in the **AWS S3 Bucket Connection** screen.

    - **Bucket name**: The S3 bucket you want to connect

    - **Role ARN**: The [role ARN](roles-aws-s3-bucket.mdx) from the AWS IAM console

    - **External ID**: The identifier allowing Trend Vision One to assume the role created in the AWS IAM console and access AWS resources as a third party

      Click the eye icon to reveal the external ID generated by Trend Vision One, then click the copy icon (![](/images/copy-icon-white=GUID-4dd3be76-c23d-48ed-8bbe-ae27229acb0e.webp)) to copy the ID. You need to add the external ID to your [custom trust policy](roles-aws-s3-bucket.mdx) in the AWS IAM console.

      For more information on external IDs, see [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.mdx).

    - **Data scope**: The data you want to send to the S3 bucket

      For more information about what data is sent, see [Data specification for AWS S3 buckets](data-spec-for-aws-s3-buckets.mdx).

    :::note

    Once you connect an S3 bucket, you cannot edit the bucket name.
    :::

4.  Click **Test Connection**.

    Each time you click **Test Connection**, a test event is added to the S3 bucket.

5.  After the test completes successfully, click **Connect** to save and connect.

6.  (Optional) On the **AWS S3 Bucket Connector** screen, use the edit (![](/images/editIcon=6e8dd682-4c7a-4aaa-8aed-6c50cfa750b2.webp)) and delete (![](/images/garbage_can_icon=GUID-11dc859c-fd77-4863-a448-d88c5a1cafd4.webp)) icons to manage your existing buckets.
