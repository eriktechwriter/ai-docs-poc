You can edit the following Server & Workload Protection settings on a user's *Settings* tab. To access the *Settings* tab, in the upper right corner of the Server & Workload Protection screen, click Server & Workload Protection User Properties to open the pop-up dialog box that includes the *Settings* tab.

:::tip

If you make changes and aren't happy with the results, you can click *Reset to Default Settings* (at the bottom of the *Settings* tab) to reset all settings on this page to their default values.
:::

### Refresh Rate {#refresh-rate}

- *Status Bar*: How often the status bar of the Server & Workload Protection refreshes during various operations such as discovering or scanning computers.

- *Alerts List/Summary*: How often to refresh the data on the *Alerts* page in *List view* or *Summary view*.

- *Computers List*: How often to refresh the data on the *Computers* page.

  :::note

  The *Last Successful Update* column value will not be recalculated unless the page is manually reloaded.
  :::

- *Computer Details*: The frequency with which an individual computer's property page refreshes itself with the latest information (if required).

### List Views {#list-views}

- *Remember last Tag filter on each page*: Events pages let you filter displayed events by Tag(s). This List Views setting determines if the "Tag" filter setting is retained when you navigate away from and return to an Events page.
- *Remember last Time filter on each page*: Events pages let you filter displayed events by Time period and computer(s). These List Views settings determine if the "Period" and "Computer" filter settings are retained when you navigate away from and return to an Events page.
- *Remember last Computer filter on each page*: Events pages let you filter displayed events by Time period and computer(s). These List Views settings determine if the "Period" and "Computer" filter settings are retained when you navigate away from and return to an Events page.
- *Remember last Advanced Search on each page*: If you have performed an "Advanced Search" on an Events page, this setting will determine if the search results are kept if you navigate away from and return to the page.
- *Number of items to show on a single page*: Screens that display lists of items will display a certain number of items per "Page". To view the next page, you must use the pagination controls. Use this setting to change the number of list-items displayed per page.
- *Maximum number of items to retrieve from database*: This setting limits the number of items that can retrieved from the database for display. This prevents the possibility of Server & Workload Protection getting bogged down trying to display an excessive number of results from a database query. If a query produces more than this many results, a message will appear at the top of the display informing you that only a portion of the results are being displayed.

:::note

Changing some of the values for the above settings will affect Server & Workload Protection performance.

### Password Protected Reports {#password-protected-reports}

- *Reports generated by this user are password protected*: When this option is selected, reports exported in PDF format will be password protected with the Report Password.
