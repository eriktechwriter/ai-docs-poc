August 8, 2025—Internet-facing assets displayed in Attack Surface Discovery that are hosted by a content delivery network (CDN) are now tagged with a CDN tag in asset profiles. CDN-hosted asset profiles might contain inaccurate information, like related assets, open ports, and services, due to the nature of content delivery network hosting. The CDN tag gives you better situational awareness about the asset.
