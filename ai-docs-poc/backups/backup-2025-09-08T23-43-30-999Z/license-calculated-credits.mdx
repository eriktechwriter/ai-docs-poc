:::: {role="main"}
If your company has purchased or renewed licenses for XDR sensors or other Trend Vision One services that support credit-based licensing, such licenses will be automatically calculated into credits upon activation.

The credits you receive retain the equivalent value, utility, and expiration date of the original license, but provide you added flexibility. No change will be made to the license agreement or renewal process.

:::warning[Important]

No action is required on your part. Trend Micro will automatically calculate the equivalent credit value of your existing subscription and add it to your credit balance.
:::

The following table describes how the credit equivalent is calculated.

:::note

<p>Enabling or disabling certain functions on on-premises gateways causes Zero Trust Secure Access to begin calculating credits for Internet Access based on the total vCPUs allocated to the corresponding Service Gateway. Actions that result in credit calculation by vCPU usage include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not requiring user authentication for endpoints connecting without the Secure Access Module installed</p></li>
<li><p>Disabling the uploading of activity data from on-premises gateways to Trend Vision One</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling ICAP mode</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling reverse proxy mode</p></li>
</ul>
Total required credits are calculated by the number of authenticated users over the last 180 days plus the daily number of allocated vCPUs. One vCPU is equivalent to 75 users.
