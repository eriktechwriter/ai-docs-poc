The **Insert X-Header** action adds an X-Header to the message header before sending a message to the intended recipients. An X-Header consists of a name field and a body field, which can be customized according to your requirements.

**Insert X-Header** is one of the "Modify" class of actions.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Insert X-Header** from the **Modify** section.

2.  Type the X-Header name and value.

    :::note

    Do not use or start your X-Header name (case-insensitive) with the following since they are reserved for Cloud Email Gateway Protection:

    - X-TM

    - X-MT

    The reserved X-Headers might be adjusted dynamically if necessary.
