Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Enable certificate based kubelet authentication.

The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate- based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.

:::note

By default, certificate-based kubelet authentication is not set.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--kubelet-client-certificate` and `--kubelet-client-key` arguments exist and they are set as appropriately.

Alternative Audit Method

``` codeblock
kubectl get pod -nkube-system -lcomponent=kube-apiserver -o=jsonpath='{range
.items[]}{.spec.containers[].command} {"\n"}{end}' | grep '--kubelet-client-certificate' |
grep -i false
```

If the exit code is '1', then the control isn't present / failed.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between the apiserver and kubelets. Then, edit API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the kubelet client certificate and key parameters as below.

``` codeblock
--kubelet-client-certificate=<path/to/client-certificate-file>
--kubelet-client-key=<path/to/client-key-file>
```
