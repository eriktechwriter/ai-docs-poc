The following example illustrates how to manually assign [recommendation scan](recommendation-scans-intro.mdx) results for Intrusion Prevention.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  After a recommendation scan is complete, open the computer page.

2.  Go to **Intrusion Prevention â†’ General**. Any unresolved recommendations appear in the Recommendations section.

3.  Click **Assign/Unassign** to open the rule assignment window.

4.  Sort the list of the recommended, unassigned rules **By Application Type**.

5.  Select **Recommended for Assignment**.

    - Recommended rules have a rectangular, or full, flag![](/images/recommended_rule=114f086b-5872-4ecd-a0a2-0548ca8efd22.webp).

    - A flag ![](/images/partially_recommended_rule=2d2059eb-bb2d-4d29-80f8-5f818f9dba86.webp) indicates that only some of the rules for the application type have been recommended.

6.  To assign a single rule to a computer, select the box next to the rule name.

    - Rules with ![](/images/warning=dfb7f735-8b48-42ab-b0eb-604833e44f85.webp) have settings that you must configure before enabling the rule.

      For example, some log inspection rules require the location of the log files. An alert appears on the computer where the recommendation was made. The text of the alert contains the information required to configure the rule.

    - Rules with ![](/images/dpi_rules_option=84381749-8bce-4bd3-82d6-ae9e9804e843.webp) have configuration options that you can set.

7.  To assign several rules at once:

    1.  Select multiple rules.

        - To select a group of rules next to each other, press and hold the Shift key.

        - To select separated rules, press and hold the Control key.

    2.  Right-click the selection.

8.  Click **Assign Rule(s)**.
