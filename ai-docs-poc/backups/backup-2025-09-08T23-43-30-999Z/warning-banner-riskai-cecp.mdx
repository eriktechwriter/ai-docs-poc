December 6, 2024—Besides the Add-in for Outlook for end user feedback, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection provides an option in ATP policy configuration for administrators to add a warning banner at the top of incoming anomalous emails detected by Correlated Intelligence predefined correlation rules. This serves as another approach for end users to report emails to Trend Micro as false positives or false negatives to help improve threat detection. The banner also provides a rationale for the warning to advise end users on exercising caution when interacting with the message.
