April 7, 2025—Trend Vision One now integrates with Google Security Operations (Google SecOps) SIEM. This integration facilitates efficient data sharing, enabling Trend Vision One to send alerts, event data, container vulnerabilities, activity data, and audit logs to Google SecOps. Configure data feeds in Google SecOps to ingest this data and enhance your security telemetry analysis.

For more information, see [Google Security Operations SIEM integration](google-secops.mdx).
