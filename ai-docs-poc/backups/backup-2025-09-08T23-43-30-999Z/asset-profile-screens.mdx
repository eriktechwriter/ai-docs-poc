View detailed information about a selected device, internet-facing asset, user account, cloud app or cloud asset.

Asset profile screens provide information to help you better understand a selected asset's impact in your organization's attack surface risk. The information can enable you to take informed actions to reduce the Cyber Risk Index.

In **Attack Surface Discovery**, click an asset name to access the asset's profile screen. In **Dashboards**, click an asset name in the **Top High-Risk Users** or **Top High-Risk Devices** widgets to access the asset's profile screen.

When viewing risk events for an asset, click the number in the case column to view current cases involving the specified risk event. Click the options icon (![](/images/options=ddb0b67f-0654-4aa5-8bc7-48ec554c5448.webp)) to open a new case for the risk event or add the case to an existing risk event.

The information available on asset profile screens differs based on the selected asset type. The following table describes each asset type.
