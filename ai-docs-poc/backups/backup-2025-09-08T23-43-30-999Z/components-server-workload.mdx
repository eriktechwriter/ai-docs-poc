Server & Workload Protection provides advanced server security for physical, virtual, and cloud servers. The platform protects enterprise applications and data from breaches and business disruptions without requiring emergency patching. This comprehensive, centrally managed platform helps you simplify security operations while enabling regulatory compliance and accelerating the ROI of virtualization and cloud projects.

Server & Workload Protection consists of the following set of components that work together to provide protection:

- The Server & Workload Protection Manager: The Protection Manager located within Trend Vision One Endpoint Security that provides centralized management to configure security policies and deploy protection to the enforcement components, the agent.

- The agent: The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent is a security agent deployed directly on a computer which provides Application Control, Anti-Malware, Web Reputation service, Firewall, Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection to protected endpoints.

- The Relay: Agents deployed with Server & Workload Protection features contain a **Relay** module. A relay-enabled agent distributes software and component updates throughout your network of Server & Workload Protection components.

  :::note

  If you enrolled your Server & Workload Protection Manager in Version Control Policies, Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents version 202412 or later do not use relays for updates. You must configure a Service Gateway with the Generic Caching Service for agents to retrieve updates.
  :::

- The notifier: The notifier is an [application](notifier-application.mdx) that communicates endpoint information about security statuses and events. For relay-enabled agents, the notifier also provides information about the component updates distributed from the endpoint.
