The **Domain-based Authentication Details** chart on the **Threat** tab of **Dashboard** displays the number of messages that failed Sender IP Match, Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) authentication based on the selected mail traffic direction.

Sender IP Match is a way that readily enables you to simultaneously allow all inbound email traffic from a particular domain while equally preventing spoofing by manually defining the allowed IP ranges. SPF, DKIM and DMARC are three email authentication systems to protect against email spoofing.

:::note

The data on this tab is displayed for incoming mail traffic only.
:::

Select a time period by **Date**, **Week**, **Month**, or **Last 12 months** to show data for the selected time period.

The specified time period only affects the data shown on this chart and its corresponding thumbnail chart on the **Threats** tab. Changing these selections does not affect other charts.

The following is the specific data displayed:
