Set up Internet Access and migrate your settings and access rules from InterScan Web Security, including InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance and InterScan Web Security Suite.

Upgrade from InterScan Web Security, including InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance and InterScan Web Security Suite, to Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access to fully integrate your secure web gateway solution with Trend Vision One. Internet Access helps you better enforce access controls and more effectively reduce risk.

The upgrade process migrates your applicable policies, cloud gateways, and other settings from InterScan Web Security to Internet Access. Migrated rules have a higher priority than any existing rules in Internet Access.

:::note

- The migration is supported for InterScan Web Security products including InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance and InterScan Web Security Suite.

- The migration does not modify your current InterScan Web Security deployment.

- Not all InterScan Web Security settings are directly migratable to Internet Access. For more information, see [InterScan Web Security Features and Settings Migration](iws-features-migration.mdx).
