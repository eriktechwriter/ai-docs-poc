Automatically mitigate user accounts with a risk score higher than 50.

Create Automated High-Risk Account Response playbooks to address and mitigate risks associated with accounts that have maintained a risk score above 50 for a specified period of time.

:::warning[Important]

To create Automated High-Risk Account Response playbooks, ensure the Attack Surface Risk Management entitlement is enabled. Additionally, complete [Zscaler Internet Access integration](Zscaler-internet-access.mdx) or [Zscaler Private Access integration](zscaler-private-access.mdx) in **Third-Party Integration**, or configure one of the following required data sources:

- Microsoft Entra ID

- Active Directory (on-premises)
:::

:::warning[Important]

This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation → Security Playbooks**.

2.  On the **Playbooks** tab, choose **Add → Create playbook**.

3.  On the **Playbook Settings** panel, select the **Account risks** type, specify a unique name for the playbook, and click **Apply**.

4.  On the **Trigger Settings** panel, select the trigger type **Automatic** and click **Apply**.

    User accounts with a risk score higher than 50 automatically trigger playbook execution.

5.  On the **Target Settings** panel, select and configure the **Target** for the playbook and click **Apply**.

    1.  From the **Risk score exceeds 50** drop-down list, select the duration when the risk score exceeds 50.

    - **Once**: The playbook targets the accounts that have reached a risk score above 50 at least once.

    - **For past 1 day**: The playbook targets the accounts that have maintained a risk score above 50 throughout the previous day.

    - **For past 2 days**: The playbook targets the accounts that have maintained a risk score above 50 for the last two days.

    This playbook mitigates only one risk type: **User with a persistent high risk score**. You can configure only one target node.

    :::warning[Important]

    To enable **Security Playbooks** to respond to accounts with high risk scores, configure [Zscaler Internet Access integration](Zscaler-internet-access.mdx) in **Third-Party Integration** or grant permission to access your Microsoft Entra ID data and Active Directory data in **Cyber Risk Overview → Data sources**.
    :::

6.  If you need to take actions when specific conditions are met, configure the **Condition** node.

    1.  Click the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) on the right of the **Target** node and click **Condition**.

    2.  Create a condition setting by specifying the **Parameter**, **Operator**, and **Value**.

        - **IS**: The condition is triggered if any of the values is matched

        - **IS NOT**: The condition is triggered if none of the values is matched

    3.  If you need to configure multiple sets of condition settings, click **Add**.

        The condition operator is evaluated using a logical AND.

    4.  Click **Apply**.

    5.  If you need to add more than one parallel **Condition** node, click the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) on the right of the **Target** node.

    6.  If you need to configure action settings for the **Condition** node, add an **Action** node by clicking the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) on the right.

        For details, see Step 7.

    7.  If you need to configure else-if conditions or else actions, add an **Else-If Condition** or **Else Action** node by clicking the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) under the **Condition** node.

        For details, see Step 9.

7.  Configure actions by adding an **Action** node.

    1.  Click the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) on the right of the **Condition** node and click **Action**.

    2.  On the **Action Settings** panel, select **Generate CSV file** or a "RESPONSE" action from the **Action** drop-down list.

        To configure the following actions, you must grant Trend Micro permission to enforce the corresponding user access policies on supported Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems:

        - Disable User Account

        - Enable User Account

        - Force Sign Out

        - Force Password Reset

        :::danger[Warning]

        If the Disable User Account action disables the account configured in Active Directory (on-premises) Connection Settings in Third-Party Integration, you will not be able to restore the disabled accounts. Trend Micro recommends requiring manual approval for this action.
        :::

        To configure the following action, you must configure [Zscaler Internet Access integration](Zscaler-internet-access.mdx) or [Zscaler Private Access integration](zscaler-private-access.mdx) in **Third-Party Integration**.

        - Add to Zscaler Restricted User Group

        :::note

        This action adds the user account to the Zscaler restricted user groups created for the Zscaler Internet Access and Zscaler Private Access services, enabling Zscaler policy enforcement.
        :::

    3.  Select whether to send a notification to request manual approval to create general actions, and then configure the notification settings if you require manual approval.

        :::note

        Actions pending manual approval for over 24 hours expire and cannot be performed.

    4.  Click **Apply**.

    5.  If you need to add more than one parallel action, use the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) on the right of the **Target** or **Condition** node.

8.  Configure notification settings by adding the second **Action** node.

    1.  Click the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) on the right of the first **Action** node and click **Action**.

    2.  On the **Action Settings** panel, specify how to notify recipients of the playbook results.

        </ul></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

    5.  If you require manual approval for sending playbook results, follow Step 3 to configure the notification settings.

        :::note

        This setting is available only to ticket notification action.
        :::

    6.  Click **Apply**.

9.  Configure **Else-If Conditions** or **Else Actions** if necessary.

    1.  Click the add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) below the **Condition** node and click **Else-If Condition** or **Else Action**.

    2.  Configure a **Condition** node by following Step 6 or an **Action** node by following Step 7 or Step 8.

    :::note

    - The nodes that can be added by using an add node (![](/images/plus_icon=e074b462-87df-4630-ab7f-552d598013d7.webp)) vary depending on the preceding node. For example, an **Action** node can only be possibly followed by another **Action** node; a **Condition** node can be followed by an **Action** node or have an **Else-If Condition** or **Else Action** attached to it.

    - When a condition is false, the playbook performs the **Else Action** or checks if its **Else-If Condition** is met. If the **Else-If Condition** is met, the playbook continues to perform the corresponding **Else Action**.

    - Multiple **Action** nodes configured in a serial mode are taken sequentially.
    :::

10. Enable the playbook by toggling the **Enable** control on.

11. Click **Save**.

    The playbook appears on the **Playbooks** tab in the **Security Playbooks** app.
