Add an enrollment certificate to generate client certificates for Zero Trust Secure Access modules and connectors.

An enrollment certificate is an SSL certificate in `.pem` format. Download the certificate signing request (CSR) file from Trend Vision One, and then generate the enrollment certificate from a certificate authority (CA). Zero Trust Secure Access supports the use of enrollment certificates on desktop and mobile devices.

For your organization's Zero Trust Secure Access modules and connectors, you can use the default certificates provided by Trend Vision One or add an enrollment certificate to generate the required module and connector client certificates.
