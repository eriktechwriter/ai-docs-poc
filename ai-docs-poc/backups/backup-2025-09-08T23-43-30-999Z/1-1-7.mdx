Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.

The `etcd` pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. `etcd` is a highly- available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of 640.
