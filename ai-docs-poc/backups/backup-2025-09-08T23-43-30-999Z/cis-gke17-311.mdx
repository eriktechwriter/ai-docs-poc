:::: {role="main"}
Profile applicability: Level 1

If `kube-proxy` is running, and if it is configured by a kubeconfig file, ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.

The `kube-proxy` kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the `kube-proxy` service on the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable only by the administrators on the system.

:::note

The default permissions of the proxy kubeconfig file are 644.

### Impact {#impact}

Overly permissive file permissions increase security risk to the platform.

### Audit {#audit}

Using Google Cloud Console

1.  Go to [Kubernetes Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list).
2.  Click on the desired cluster to open the Details page, then click on the desired Node pool to open the Node pool Details page.
3.  Note the name of the desired node.
4.  Go to [VM Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
5.  Find the desired node and click on **SSH** to open an SSH connection to the node.

Using Command Line

Method 1: SSH to the worker nodes

1.  To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:

    ``` codeblock
    sudo systemctl status kubelet
    ```

2.  The output should return `Active: active (running) since...`. Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate kubeconfig file:

    ``` codeblock
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

3.  The output of the above command should return something similar to `--kubeconfig/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig`, which is the location of the kubeconfig file.

4.  Run this command to obtain the kubeconfig file permissions:

    ``` codeblock
    stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig
    ```

5.  The output of the above command gives you the kubeconfig file's permissions. Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive.

Method 2: Create and Run a Privileged Pod

1.  Run a pod that is privileged enough to access the host's file system by deploying a pod that uses the hostPath volume to mount the node's file system into the pod. Here's an example of a simple pod definition that mounts the root of the host to /host within the pod:

    ``` codeblock
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: file-check
    spec:
    volumes:
    - name: host-root
    hostPath:
    path: /
    type: Directory
    containers:
    - name: nsenter
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: host-root
    mountPath: /host
    securityContext:
    privileged: true
    ```

2.  Save this to a file (e.g., file-check-pod.yaml) and create the pod:

    ``` codeblock
    kubectl apply -f file-check-pod.yaml
    ```

3.  Once the pod is running, you can exec into it to check file permissions on the node:

    ``` codeblock
    kubectl exec -it file-check -- sh
    ```

4.  Now you are in a shell inside the pod, but you can access the node's file system through the /host directory and check the permission level of the file:

    ``` codeblock
    ls -l /host/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig
    ```

5.  Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

``` codeblock
chmod 644 <proxy kubeconfig file>
```
