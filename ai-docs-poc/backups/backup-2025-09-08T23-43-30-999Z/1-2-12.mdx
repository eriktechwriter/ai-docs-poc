Profile applicability: Level 2 - Master Node

Automate service accounts management.

When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the `default` service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens.

:::note

By default, `ServiceAccount` is set.
:::

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--disable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that does not includes `ServiceAccount`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Follow the documentation and create `ServiceAccount` objects as per your environment. Then, edit the API server pod specification file` /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter is set to a value that does not include `ServiceAccount`.
