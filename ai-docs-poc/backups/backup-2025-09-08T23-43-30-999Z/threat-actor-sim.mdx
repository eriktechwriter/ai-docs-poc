Run a threat actor attack simulation in Trend Vision One with one deployed Virtual Network Sensor, connected Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, or connected TippingPoint device with Network Sensor enabled.

The threat actor attack simulation requires that you prepare one deployed [Virtual Network Sensor](network-sensors-deploy-guides.mdx), connected [Deep Discovery Inspector appliance](ddi-connection-deployment.mdx), or connected [TippingPoint](tippingpoint-sms-connection-guides.mdx) device with Network Sensor enabled.

### Procedure {#procedure}
