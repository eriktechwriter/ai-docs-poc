Trend Micro Apex Central includes the following compliance indicators and performs compliance calculations based on the indicator settings and the user and endpoint information synchronized from Active Directory servers. You can view the information for the compliance indicators on the **Security Posture** dashboard tab.

- **Antivirus Pattern Compliance**: The percentage of managed Apex One Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents using acceptable antivirus pattern (Virus Pattern and Smart Scan Agent Pattern) versions

- **Data Loss Prevention Compliance**: The percentage of managed Data Discovery-enabled Apex One and Cloud App Security agents with an acceptable number of sensitive data detection incidents

The following provides an overview of the procedures to get Trend Micro Apex Central to perform compliance calculations and display compliance information on the **Security Posture** dashboard tab.
