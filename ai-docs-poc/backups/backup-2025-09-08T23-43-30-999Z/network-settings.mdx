### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Global Agent Settings**.

2.  Click the **Network** tab.

3.  Configure settings as required.

    <td><p><strong>Enable the Security Agent to create a single virus/malware log entry for recurring detections of the same virus/malware within an hour</strong>: Consolidates virus log entries when detecting multiple infections from the same virus/malware over a short period of time</p>
    <p>The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent may detect a single virus/malware multiple times, quickly filling the virus/malware logs and consuming network bandwidth when sending log information to the server. Enabling this feature helps reduce both the number of virus/malware log entries made and the amount of network bandwidth Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents consume when reporting malware log information to the server.</p></td>

    <ul>
    <li><p>If the Apex One server has both an IPv4 and IPv6 address, you can type an IPv4 address range and IPv6 prefix and length.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p>Type an IPv4 address range if the server is pure IPv4, or an IPv6 prefix and length if the server is pure IPv6.</p>
    <p>When any Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent IP address matches an IP address in the range, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent applies the heartbeat and server polling settings and the server treats the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent as part of the unreachable network.</p>
    

    :::note
    
    <p>Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents with an IPv4 address can connect to a pure IPv4 or dual-stack Apex One server.</p>
    <p>Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents with an IPv6 address can connect to a pure IPv6 or dual-stack Apex One server.</p>
    <p>Dual-stack Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents can connect to dual-stack, pure IPv4, or pure IPv6 Apex One server.</p>

    <li><p>In <strong>Agents send heartbeat every __ minute(s)</strong>, specify how often Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents send heartbeat. Type a value between 1 and 129600 minutes.</p></li>
    <li><p>In <strong>An agent is offline if there is no heartbeat after __ minute(s)</strong>, specify how much time without a heartbeat must elapse before the Apex One server treats the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent as offline. Type a value between 1 and 129600 minutes.</p></li>
