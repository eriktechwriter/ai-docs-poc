::: {role="main"}
The Advanced Threat Scan Engine (ATSE) uses a combination of pattern-based scanning and heuristic scanning to detect document exploits and other threats used in targeted attacks. By default, this engine is enabled for virus scanning policies.

Its major features include:

- Detection of zero-day threats

- Detection of embedded exploit code

- Detection rules for known vulnerabilities

- Enhanced parsers for handling file deformities
