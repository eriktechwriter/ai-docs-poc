Identify applications with potential security vulnerabilities that are in use within your organization.

Attack Surface Discovery detects all local applications, connected SaaS applications, and public cloud applications that have been accessed by your organization's users and devices. Trend Vision One categorizes and assigns a reputation score or asset risk score to each application. The consolidated visibility of all apps in your environment helps you to identify potential vulnerabilities, continuously assess and prioritize risk, and strengthen your security posture.

The following table describes the tabs available in the Applications section of Attack Surface Discovery.
