The Protection widget provides a real-time display of the number of threat and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) alerts detected within your environment. This widget serves as a quick reference to assess the current security status and potential risks.

From the Protection widget, you can:

- View the number of current threat and XDR alerts, including the number of alerts that have occurred in the last 24 hours.

- Click the number above Threat alerts or XDR alerts to open Threat and Exposure Management in a new tab, filtered to show details of that alert type.
