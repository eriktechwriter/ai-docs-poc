September 20, 2024 – Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection utilizes detection and quarantine logs to identify false positive emails detected by Advanced Spam Protection, Web Reputation, and Correlated Intelligence. It then automatically reverses the Quarantine, Move to Junk Email folder, Move to Spam actions, delivering the emails directly to end users' inboxes. This feature functions without user intervention and is independent of whether Retro Scan & Auto Remediate is activated by administrators in Advanced Spam Protection and Web Reputation settings.
