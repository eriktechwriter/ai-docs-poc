Create or edit one-time or recurring template-based reports based on security data within your environment.

Template-based reports are a quick and easy way to create scheduled and one-time reports using data from a single Trend Vision One app. To combine data from multiple templates into a single report, you can [create a custom report](configuring-custom-report.mdx).

:::note

The availability of certain report templates and data sources depends on your license entitlement for the associated app or service. For more information, see [Reports license requirements](reports-license-requirements.mdx).
