The Compliance and Cloud Risk Management Report scores your cloud infrastructure as PASS or FAIL for each control within [supported Standards and Frameworks](compliance-in-cloud-posture.mdx).

- All controls are organized into sections and headers that map to those within the Standards and Frameworks itself as set by the standard or framework authority.
- The report comes with % pass and % fail scores based on the total checks that have passed and failed for Trend Vision One™ – Cloud Risk Management rules mapped to the standard or framework controls.
- Using the report, you can get an instant assessment of your organization’s cloud infrastructure compliance, and accordingly, take remediation measures to improve compliance levels, thereby potentially avoiding non-compliance reactive fixes and expenditures.

### What is a control? {#what-is-a-control}

A control is the passable element of a standard or framework that can be determined to PASS, FAIL, or be otherwise assessed.

### Compliance and Cloud Risk Management Report Layout {#compliance-and-cloud-risk-management-report-layout}

In the Compliance and Cloud Risk Management Report, the grouping of the controls is defined by the control family. Cloud Risk Management interprets the standards and frameworks and map rules to each control and control family. Each rule has a pre-existing category assigned to it based on an assessment of which pillar of the AWS Well-Architected framework a rule belongs to. These pillars may or may not align with the categorizations used by a framework or standard Cloud Risk Management audits against.
