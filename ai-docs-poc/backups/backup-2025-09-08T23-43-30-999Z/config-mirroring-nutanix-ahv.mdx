Learn how to configure traffic mirroring for your own Virtual Network Sensor on Nutanix AHV.

Nutanix AHV supports traffic mirroring. Paid subscribers should refer to the most current documentation version at the [Nutanix AHV website](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/list?type=software&filterKey=software&filterVal=AHV) for more information. You can use the following procedure to configure traffic mirroring on the Nutanix host.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  SSH to CVM.

2.  Enter the following command to identify the UUID of your VM:

    ``` codeblock
    acli vm.list
    ```

3.  SSH to the Nutanix host.

4.  Enter the following command to identify the name of the interface according to its MAC address. **Note:** This requires use of the data port of your VNS and the sources mirrored to it.

    ``` codeblock
    virsh domiflist <YOUR-VM-UUID>
    ```

5.  Enter the following command to identify the name of the vswitch attached to your VM:

    ``` codeblock
    ovs-vsctl show
    ```

6.  Enter the following command to clear mirror settings:

    ``` codeblock
    ovs-vsctl clear bridge ovsbr mirrors
    ```

7.  Configure SPAN settings, as in the following example:

    ``` codeblock
    ovs-vsctl \
         -- set bridge ovsbr mirrors=@m \
         -- --id=@s1 get port vnet1 \
         -- --id=@s2 get port vnet2 \
         -- --id=@d get port vnet0 \
         -- --id=@m create mirror name=m0 select-dst-port=@s1,
              @s2 select-src-port=@s1,@s2 output-port=@d 
              select-all=true
    ```

    :::note

    The preceding example uses `vnet0` as the destination and `vnet1`, `vnet2` as the source. You can change the port names according to the needs of your deployment.

8.  Enter the following commands to verify your mirror settings:

    ``` codeblock
    ovs-vsctl -- list bridge
    ```

    ``` codeblock
    ovs-vsctl -- list mirror
    ```

    :::note

    Users of ERSPAN must add a NIC for their VNS from the user interface, and ensure that the VNS data port IP can be routed.
    :::

    After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command `show traffic` to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic. For more information about troubleshooting, see [Virtual Network Sensor FAQ](virtual-network-sensor-faqs.mdx) and [Virtual Network Sensor CLI commands](virtual-network-sensor-cli-commands.mdx).
