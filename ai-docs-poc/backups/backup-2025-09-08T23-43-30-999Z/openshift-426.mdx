Profile applicability: Level 1

Do not disable timeouts on streaming connections.

Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports.

:::note

By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases.
:::

:::note

By default, `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` is set to 4 hours.

### Impact {#impact}

Long-lived connections could be interrupted.

### Audit {#audit}

OpenShift uses the kubernetes default of 4 hours for the `streaming-connection-idle-timeout` argument. Unless the cluster administrator has added the value to the node configuration, the default will be used. The value is a timeout for HTTP streaming sessions going through a kubelet, like the port-forward, exec, or attach pod operations. The `streaming-connection-idle-timeout` should not be disabled by setting it to zero, but it can be lowered.

:::note

If the value is set too low, then users using those features may experience a service interruption due to the timeout.
:::

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new `kubelet-config-controller` added to the Machine Config Controller. This allows you to create a `KubeletConfig` custom resource to edit the kubelet parameters.

Run the following command to view the streaming connection timeout for each node:

``` codeblock
for node in $(oc get nodes -ojsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do
oc get --raw /api/v1/nodes/$node/proxy/configz | jq
'.kubeletconfig.streamingConnectionIdleTimeout'
done
```

Verify the values returned for each node are not 0.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Follow the instructions in the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.mdx) to create a `kubeletconfig` custom resource and set the `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to the desired value. Do not set the value to 0.
