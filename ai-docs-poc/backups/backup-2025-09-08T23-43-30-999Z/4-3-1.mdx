Profile applicability: Level 1 - Worker Node

Do not bind the kube-proxy metrics port to non-loopback addresses.

kube-proxy has two APIs which provided access to information about the service and can be bound to network ports. The metrics API service includes endpoints (`/metrics `and `/configz`) which disclose information about the configuration and operation of kube-proxy. These endpoints should not be exposed to untrusted networks as they do not support encryption or authentication to restrict access to the data they provide.

:::note

The default value is `127.0.0.1:10249`.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

3rd party services which try to access metrics or configuration information related to kube-proxy will require access to the localhost interface of the node.

### Audit {#audit}

Review the start-up flags provided to kube proxy.

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep -i kube-proxy
```

Ensure that the `--metrics-bind-address` parameter is not set to a value other than 127.0.0.1. From the output of this command gather the location specified in the `--config` parameter. Review any file stored at that location and ensure that it does not specify a value other than 127.0.0.1 for `metricsBindAddress`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Modify or remove any values which bind the metrics service to a non-localhost address.
