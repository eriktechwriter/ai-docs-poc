Configure the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) integration to add Trend Vision One users with a high risk exposure to Zscaler-defined restricted user groups and apply Zscaler policies to those groups.

:::warning[Important]

The following instructions and screen captures were valid as of July 29, 2024. For more information, see Zscaler documentation.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Create a user group in your selected identity provider (IdP) and sync the group to ZIA.

    For more information, see the documentation for your selected IdP.

    :::note

    Trend Micro recommends creating a user group specifically for the Zscaler integration, rather than reusing an existing group.

    Make note of the name of the user group, and avoid modifying the name or other group settings once the integration is configured.
    :::

2.  Create a ZIA policy to associate with the user group on the [Zscaler Internet Access Admin Portal](https://admin.zscaler.net/).

    For more information, see [Zscaler documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/configuring-advanced-settings).

3.  Obtain the base URL and bearer token of the IdP from the ZIA platform.

    1.  Go to **Administration → Authentication Settings → Identity Providers**.

        Make sure you already have one or more IdPs configured in Zscaler. If you have not yet configured any IdPs, see [Zscaler documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/adding-identity-providers) for instructions.

    2.  Choose an IdP and click the edit icon.

        :::note

        Trend Micro recommends selecting the IdP marked **Default IdP**.
        :::

        The **Edit IdP** window appears.

    3.  Under **PROVISIONING OPTIONS**, use the toggle to enable the **Enable SCIM Provisioning** setting.

        :::note

        Trend Vision One does not support SAML auto-provisioning.
        :::

    4.  Copy and retain the **Base URL** of the IdP.

    5.  Copy and retain the **Bearer Token** of the IdP, or click **Generate Token** to create a new bearer token.

    7.  Back on the **Authentication Settings** screen, click **Save**.

4.  In the Trend Vision One console, enable the integration and configure the settings.

    1.  Make sure that your selected IdP is configured as a data source in Cyber Risk Exposure Management.

        For more information, see [Configure Cyber Risk Exposure Management data sources](configuring-data-sources.mdx).

    2.  Go to **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration**.

    3.  Click **Zscaler Internet Access**.

    4.  Use the **Enable Zscaler Internet Access integration** toggle to enable the service.

    5.  Paste in the **Base URL** and **Bearer token** obtained from the Zscaler platform.

    6.  Specify the **Restricted user group name** of the group you created in your IdP.

    7.  (Optional) Click **Test Connection** to authenticate the base URL, bearer token, and selected group.

    8.  Click **Save**.

        The **Add to Zscaler Restricted User Group** and **Remove from Zscaler Restricted User Group** response actions appear in the context menu in Cyber Risk Exposure Management.
