:::: {role="main"}
Collect evidence to support threat investigation and incident response.

This task is supported by the following services:

- Trend Vision One

  - Windows agent

After [creating a workspace and adding endpoints to the workspace](workspaces.mdx) in the **Forensics** app, you can collect detailed evidence from potentially compromised endpoints for internal investigations into critical incidents that occurred on your network and may require further attention.

:::warning[Important]

- Evidence collection requires that you enable *XDR endpoint sensor* on target endpoints.

- Evidence archives use the same folder structures as the SANS Institutes and CyLR tool.
:::

This task automatically adds all collected evidence to the workspace.

### Procedure {#procedure}
