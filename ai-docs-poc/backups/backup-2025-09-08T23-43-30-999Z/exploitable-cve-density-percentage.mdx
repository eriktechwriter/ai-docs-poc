Evaluate your organization's exposure to CVEs to help tailor your mitigation efforts.

To better assist you in determining and responding to your organization's vulnerabilities, Trend Micro designed certain metrics to complement each other for greater clarity.

The Vulnerability Percentages and CVE Density widgets work together to help you tailor your response to vulnerabilities. Click on the entry for the CVE density or percentage of a particular type of asset to view a list of affected assets.

:::warning[Important]

- CVE counts for hosts only include high-impact and medium-impact CVEs based on global exploit activity and Trend Micro threat expert evaluations.

- Vulnerability Assessment is only supported on Windows desktop platforms starting from Windows 10 and select Linux platforms. For more information, see [Vulnerability Assessment supported operating systems](vulnerability-assessment-os.mdx).

Using CVE density and vulnerability percentages together helps you obtain a more accurate picture of your organization's risk profile.

<ul>
<li><p>Company A has a small number of internal assets with a large number of CVEs, which could indicate the company regularly applies patches and only a limited subset of endpoints have not received the latest update.</p></li>
<li><p>Company B has a large number of internal assets with a large number of CVEs, which could indicate that the company delays patching endpoints, possibly due to internal testing requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examining both metrics can help determine the best method to reduce CVE vulnerabilities.</p></td>
