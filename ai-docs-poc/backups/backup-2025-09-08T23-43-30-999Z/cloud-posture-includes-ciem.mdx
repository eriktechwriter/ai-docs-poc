October 21, 2024—Get central visibility of your cloud entitlements and related risks in Cloud Risk Management. With over 200 different types of cloud resources currently available, cloud operations and security teams are increasingly challenges by the complexity of cloud infrastructure entitlement management.

A dedicated entitlements tab in Cloud Security Posture now gives users centralized visibility into cloud identities and related risks. Take action and focus remediation efforts based on prioritized risks, including risky identity types, identity misconfigurations, and potential attack paths. To learn more, see [Entitlements](conformityentitlements.mdx).
