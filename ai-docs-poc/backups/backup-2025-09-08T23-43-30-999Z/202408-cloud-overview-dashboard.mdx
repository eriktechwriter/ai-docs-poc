August 12, 2024â€”You can now access the new Cloud Security Posture dashboard, which provides a comprehensive summary of cloud assets. Additionally, the page previously known as "Cloud Posture Overview" has been renamed to "Compliance and Misconfiguration."

The Cloud Security Posture dashboard offers detailed insights into related risk findings, including misconfiguration, compliance, vulnerability, threats, identity risk, and data posture.

These updates ensure a more streamlined and informative experience, enabling you to quickly identify and address potential risks in your cloud environment.
