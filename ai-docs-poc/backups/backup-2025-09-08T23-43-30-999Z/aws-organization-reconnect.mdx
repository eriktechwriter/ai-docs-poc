Fix an unhealthy connection or partial deployment failure for your AWS organization account.

:::warning[Important]

This topic is for troubleshooting a partial or failed stack deployment to an AWS organization. To update the feature stack normally for an AWS account or AWS organization, see [AWS Stack Update](stack-update.mdx).
:::

If you attempted to connect your AWS organization but see the following **Available actions** you might need to reattempt stack deployment:

- **Reconnect**: This status might occur if the feature stack failed to fully deploy or if the connection with the account is unhealthy.

- **Update feature stack**: This status might occur for new feature releases, if you changed permissions settings without redeploying, or if an update failed to fully deploy.

To resolve the status and fix the partial deployment, use the following steps:
