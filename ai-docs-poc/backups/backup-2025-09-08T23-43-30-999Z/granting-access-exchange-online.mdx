Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports using OAuth 2.0 to access Exchange Online with a service account (Authorized Account). With the OAuth 2.0 framework, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection obtains an access token to get limited access on the Global Administrator's behalf to run advanced threat protection and data loss prevention scanning on email messages in protected mailboxes.

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports two protection modes for Exchange Online. For details, see [Protection modes for email services](protection-modes-for-email-services.mdx). Each mode requires separate access grant.
