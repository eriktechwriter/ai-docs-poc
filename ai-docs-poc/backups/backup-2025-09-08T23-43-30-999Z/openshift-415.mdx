Profile applicability: Level 1

Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.

The `kubelet.conf` file is the `kubeconfig` file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, OpenShift sets the default permissions for the `kubelet.conf` to 644.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command to check the permissions of the `kubelet.conf` on each node:

``` codeblock
for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
         oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %a
/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
done
```

Verify that the permissions are 644.
