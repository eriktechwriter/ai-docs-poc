Attack Surface Discovery lists all assets discovered in your organization to facilitate risk assessments. Trend Micro leverages several data sources for asset discovery, which are now presented in the Discovered by column of the Device List for further investigation. You can also configure Device Overview to show only specific sources by adding the Discovered by filter.
