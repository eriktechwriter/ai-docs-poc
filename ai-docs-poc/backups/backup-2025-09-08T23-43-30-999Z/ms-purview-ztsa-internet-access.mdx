September 11, 2023—Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access has extended its Data Loss Prevention capability by integrating with Microsoft Purview Information Protection. You can now synchronize your published sensitivity labels and add them into Data Loss Prevention rules to let Internet Access block protected files with sensitivity labels from being sent outside your organization.

For details, see [Adding a data loss prevention rule](adding-data-loss-prevention-rule.mdx).
