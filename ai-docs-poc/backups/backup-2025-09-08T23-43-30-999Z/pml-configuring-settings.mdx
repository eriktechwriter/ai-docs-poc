Predictive Machine Learning requires that you enable the following services:

- Unauthorized Change Prevention

- Advanced Protection Service
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Enable Predictive Machine Learning**.

2.  Configure the **Monitoring Level** settings for **Detection** and **Prevention**.

    :::warning[Important]

    - Higher monitoring levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends selecting **2 - Moderate** for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints.

    - The **Prevention** level must be the same or lower than **Detection**.
    :::

3.  Under **Detection Settings**, select the type of detections and related action that Predictive Machine Learning takes.

    <td><p><strong>File</strong></p></td>
    <td><ul>
    <li><p><strong>Quarantine</strong>: Select to automatically quarantine files that exhibit malware-related features based on the Predictive Machine Learning analysis</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Log only</strong>: Select to scan unknown files and log the Predictive Machine Learning analysis for further in-house investigation of the threat</p></li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Process</strong></p></td>
    <td><ul>
    <li><p><strong>Terminate</strong>: Select to automatically terminate processes or scripts that exhibit malware-related behaviors based on the Predictive Machine Learning analysis</p>
    

    :::warning[Important]
    
    <p>Predictive Machine Learning attempts to clean the files that executed the malicious processes or scripts. If the clean action is unsuccessful, Predictive Machine Learning quarantines the affected files.</p>

    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

4.  Under **Exceptions**, configure the global Predictive Machine Learning file exceptions to prevent all agents from detecting a file as malicious.

    1.  When configuring a parent policy, specify how other users can configure child policies.

        - **Inherit from parent**: Child policies must use the settings configured in the parent policy

        - **Extend from parent**: Child policies can append additional settings to the settings inherited from the parent policy

          :::note

          If your child policies **Extend from parent**, you can configure **Child Policy Restrictions** to prevent child policies from adding specified rules to the Rule Exceptions list.
          :::

    2.  Click **Add File Hash**.

        The **Add File to Exception List** screen appears.

        :::note

        Use the **Import** and **Export** buttons to share the list with different policies.
        :::

    3.  Specify the file SHA-1 hash value to exclude from scanning.

    4.  Optionally provide a note regarding the reason for the exception or to describe the file name(s) associated with the hash value.

    5.  Click **Add**.

        Predictive Machine Learning adds the file hash to the Exceptions list.
