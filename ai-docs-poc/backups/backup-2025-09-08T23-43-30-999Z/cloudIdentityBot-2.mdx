With over 530 rules across six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization and Sustainability), the Cloud Risk Management Scan [ingests meta-data from your AWS accounts](aws-integration.mdx) and automates the task of ensuring your cloud infrastructure remains reliable, scalable, efficient, and secure. The comprehensive nature of the rules engine, along with our continuous delivery philosophy ensures any potential risks are identified immediately and prioritized according to the potential impact on your business.
