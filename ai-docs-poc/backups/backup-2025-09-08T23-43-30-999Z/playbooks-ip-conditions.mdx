June 4, 2024—Automated Response Playbooks are enhanced to include **IP address** as a condition in playbook settings in addition to **Highlighted object risk**. With this enhancement, the playbooks can filter highlighted objects with their source IP address, destination IP address, peer IP address, and interested IP address, enabling more targeted response actions.

For more information, see [Create Automated Response Playbooks](create-automated-response-playbooks.mdx).
