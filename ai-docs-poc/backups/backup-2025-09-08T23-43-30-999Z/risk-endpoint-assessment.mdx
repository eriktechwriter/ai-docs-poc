Scan high-profile endpoints for file-based threat indicators and malicious file activity.

You can always find your previous assessment reports by clicking **Assessment History** on the **Cyber Risk Assessment** screen.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Assessment â†’ Cyber Risk Assessment**.

2.  In the **At-Risk Endpoint Assessment** area, click **Start Assessment**.

3.  On the **At-Risk Endpoints** screen, deploy the assessment tool on the target endpoints and select the endpoints to assess.

    1.  Click **Download Assessment Tool**.

    2.  Deploy the assessment tool using your preferred system utility or share the download link with users.

        For more information, see [Deploying the assessment tool to Windows endpoints](deploy-assessment-tool-windows.mdx) and [Deploying the assessment tool to macOS endpoints](deploy-assessment-tool-macos.mdx).

        :::note

        Attack Surface Discovery continuously identifies known and unknown assets in your environment to inform your attack exposure and security configuration. Scanning as many endpoints as possible helps expand your view of the attack surface and find threats that might have evaded your existing security solutions.
        :::

    3.  Select the endpoints to assess by clicking **Select Endpoints From Inventory**, and then click **Run Assessment tool**.

        You can select a maximum of 1,000 endpoints at a time.

        :::warning[Important]

        In order for the tool to automatically scan and upload data back to the **Cyber Risk Assessment** app, make sure that the endpoints are online and allowed to connect to Trend Vision One.
        :::

4.  Wait until all your endpoints finish the assessment.

    You will receive an email notification when the assessment is complete. Click the link in the notification to access the Trend Vision One console, and click **View Report** in the **At-Risk Endpoint Assessment** area.

5.  Check the results on the assessment report and take risk remediation actions immediately if necessary.

    The following table lists the actions available on the report (if applicable).
