June 21, 2024—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection officially launches Inline Protection for Gmail to scan inbound and outbound emails before they are delivered to their destinations, with no MX record change required. This protection mode blocks threats before they can reach your users' mailboxes and prevents data leakage before it actually takes place.
