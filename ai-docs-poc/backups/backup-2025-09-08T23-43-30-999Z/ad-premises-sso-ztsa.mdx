Integrate with Active Directory (on-premises) to authenticate user access attempts and take action on risky account activity.

Active Directory (on-premises) integration requires the use of a Service Gateway, third-party integration settings, and SSO.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Prepare a [VMware ESXi](sg-virtual-app-vmware-esxi.mdx) or [Microsoft Hyper-V](deploy-virtual-appliance-ms-hyper-v.mdx) Service Gateway appliance that connects to your on-premises Active Directory server.

2.  Go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Identity and Access Management**.

3.  Click **Grant permissions** next to **Active Directory (on-premises)**.

    A new browser tab opens to the **Third-Party Integration \> Active Directory (on-premises)** screen.

4.  Connect your Active Directory server to Trend Vision One by [configuring Active Directory (on-premises) integration](ad-premises-integration.mdx).

5.  Configure SSO based on the authentication protocol that your on-premises Active Directory system supports.

    - SAML-based SSO: [Configure Active Directory Federation Services](configuring-adfs.mdx)

    - NTLM or Kerberos-based SSO for Internet Access: [NTLM or Kerberos single sign-on for Internet Access](ntlm-single-sign-internet-access.mdx)
