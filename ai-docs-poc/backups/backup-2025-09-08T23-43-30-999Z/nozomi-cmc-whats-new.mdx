August 25, 2025—Trend Vision One now integrates with the Nozomi Networks Central Management Console (CMC) on-premises platform to streamline and centralize your security operations. To enable the Nozomi CMC integration, configure your API authentication settings in Nozomi CMC and install the Third-party security data forwarding service on your deployed Service Gateway. Data forwarded to Trend Vision One includes consolidated asset inventory and security alerts from distributed industrial control systems across multiple sites. The integration enables secure data feeds and strengthens your unified IT/OT security posture with enhanced multi-site threat correlation and centralized visibility.
