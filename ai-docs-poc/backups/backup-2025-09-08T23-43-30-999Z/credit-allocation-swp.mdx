When upgrading to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security, your existing license entitlements are automatically converted to Trend Vision One credits upon activation.

The following license entitlements, among others, are converted to credits according to their respective conversion rates:

- Trend Vision One Endpoint Security - Core: 45 credits redeemed per seat

- Trend Vision One Endpoint Security - Essentials: 65 credits redeemed per seat

- Trend Vision One Endpoint Security - Pro: 300 credits redeemed per seat

For example, if you have a *Trend Vision One Endpoint Security - Pro* license with 10 seats, the seats are automatically redeemed in the form of 3,000 credits (10 seats x 300 credits).

For information on all license entitlements that are converted into credits, see [License entitlements calculated into credits](license-calculated-credits.mdx) or [Trend Vision One Endpoint Security License to Credit Convert Rate](https://success.trendmicro.com/dcx/s/solution/000296988?language=en_US).

Once a license entitlement is converted into credits, the credits are automatically added to your overall credit balance. Trend Vision One automatically allocates credits based on the Endpoint Security features that you enable.

Credits can be allocated to the following Trend Vision One Endpoint Security offerings:

- Endpoint sensor detection and response: 20 credits required per deployment

- Advanced Endpoint Security: 45 credits required per deployment

- Advanced Server & Workload Protection: 235 credits required per deployment

For example, if you enable Advanced Server & Workload Protection for two deployments, 470 credits (2 deployments x 235 credits) are allocated to the offering from your overall balance.

:::note

Server & Workload Protection contains a variety of [protection modules](configure-protection-modules.mdx) that expand your security capabilities. Credits are allocated towards different Endpoint Security offerings depending on which modules you use.

Certain modules are exclusive to Advanced Server & Workload Protection deployments, meaning that their use requires 235 credits per deployment. If you only want to allocate credits towards Endpoint sensor detection and response or Advanced Endpoint Security deployments, avoid using the following modules:

- Intrusion Prevention (Server applications)

- Integrity Monitoring

- Log Inspection

- Container Protection
:::

Server & Workload Protection supports running [recommendation scans](recommendation-scans-intro.mdx) on the Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection modules. Enabling recommendation scans causes Trend Vision One to allocate credits to both Advanced Endpoint Security (45 credits) and Advanced Server & Workload Protection (235 credits), for a total of 280 credits per deployment. For more information, see [Classic recommendation scan](classic-reco-scan.mdx).

For information on all Trend Vision One offerings requiring credits, see [Credit requirements for Trend Vision One solutions, capabilities, and features](credit-req-for-apps-services.mdx).
