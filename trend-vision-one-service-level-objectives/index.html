TREND VISION ONE™ (herein this “SLO”)</h1></header><p>v. Oct 2021</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><u>Purpose</u>. This SLO is applicable to each Trend Vision One Solution (herein, “<strong>Vision One Solution</strong>”) that is offered for sale by Trend Micro. This SLO describes certain internal objectives for the delivery of each Vision One Solution and does not apply to any other Trend Micro product or service. Access to and use of each Vision One Solution is subject to acceptance of and agreement to the terms and conditions of the applicable Terms of Use or Terms of Service, as may be applicable, for Vision One Solution(s) as published (collectively, the “<strong>Terms of Use</strong>”). In the event of any specific conflict between the Terms of Use and those of this Service Level Objectives, the conflicting terms set forth in this Service Level Agreement will prevail. Terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Application</u>. This SLO is only applicable to a Vision One Solution customer having a paid right to access and use one or more Vision One Solution(s) as evidenced by such customer having agreed to the Terms of Use for the relevant Vision One Solution that has not expired or been terminated by either party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Definitions</u></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“Scheduled Maintenance” means periods of downtime related to network, hardware, or service maintenance or upgrades. Trend Micro will publish notice or notify Company one (1) to two (2) weeks prior to the commencement of each Scheduled Maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Emergency Maintenance” means unscheduled maintenance periods during which a Vision One Solution may be disrupted or prevented due to non-availability or any maintenance for which Trend Micro could not have reasonably prepared for the need for such maintenance, and failure to perform the maintenance would adversely impact the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Service Availability” means access to the web administration console for a Vision One Solution using a web browser, programmatic access using Application Programming Interfaces (API’s), and connectivity between any software portion of the Vision One Solution installed in the customer environment (agents, clients, gateways, network appliances) and the portion of the Vision One Solution hosted on behalf of Trend Micro by its IaaS third party service providers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Conditions of this SLO</u>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The customer must have and maintain an environment that has Internet access in order to use a Vision One Solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The customer must have and maintain access to a browser application supported by the Vision One Solution to use the Web-based administrative console.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The customer understands and agrees that its Vision One Solution security policies and security events are also logged or recorded by the Vision One Solution in the performance of the provided offering as agreed in the Terms of Use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The customer must take all necessary measures to ensure that it and all of its employees are aware of and in compliance with any requirements, responsibilities and limitations set forth in the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, any applicable data privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations, as well as Trend Micro’s Acceptable Use Policy as published in the Terms of Use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Service Availability</u>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each Vision One Solution is hosted twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week in Trend Micro’s managed public IaaS environment hosted by its third party service providers. Each Vision One Solution systems, networks, and capacity are continually monitored by Trend Micro and its IaaS third party service providers to provide optimal availability and efficiency to Vision One Solution customers. The target Service Availability is 99.9% in each calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trend Micro uses commercially reasonable efforts to make available each Vision One Solution on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week basis. However, as described in this SLO, each Vision One Service may be unavailable due to scheduled maintenance, unscheduled downtime or unforeseen circumstances including suspension of a Vision One Solution to mitigate any malicious activities, in which event, Trend Micro shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reinstate the Vision One Solution as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trend Micro strives to perform most, if not all, software upgrades without service impact to customers. Periodically, Trend Micro will schedule maintenance of a Vision One Solution by striving to provide customer at least seven (7) days’ notice since such maintenance may cause disruption of that Vision One Solution. Within any Scheduled Maintenance window Trend Micro can announce further extension of the outage period before 30 minutes of the end of the Scheduled Maintenance. An extension cannot exceed the maintenance time by more than 8 hours or double the planned maintenance time (whichever is less) unless a need for Emergency Maintenance arises. Scheduled maintenance shall not exceed more than eight (8) hours per calendar month except as may be imposed by any IaaS third party service providers over which Trend Micro has no control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at any time the continued availability of a Vision One Solution would compromise the security of such Vision One Solution due, but not limited, to hacking attempts, denial of service attacks, or other activities that may be malicious, due to negligence or misconfiguration, either directed at or originating from a customer’s environment, Trend Micro may temporarily suspend, in part or in whole, Vision One Solution(s) as to such customer and/or other customers. In such an event, Trend Micro will promptly inform affected customer(s) and will work to resolve such issues, reinstating the affected Vision One Solution(s) at the earliest opportunity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Disaster Recovery</u>. Trend Micro maintains, updates, and periodically tests, a disaster recovery plan in connection with each Vision One Solution. Because each Vision One Solution is a Web-based cloud service, there may be Excused Performance Events beyond the reasonable control of Trend Micro that may impact a Vision One Solution as is more fully described in the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>The following objectives are provided each Vision One Solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) – No more than 5 hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovery Point Objective (RPO) – No more than 24 hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Relationship to Third Parties</u>. As is more fully described in the Terms of Use and documents referenced therein, Trend Micro utilizes the services of third party subprocessors in connection with each Vision One Solution. As such, the provision of Vision One Solution is somewhat dependent on the performance of each such subprocessor, each of which, provides Trend Micro the benefit of its service level agreements. For a list of subprocessors for each Vision One Solution, please visit <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/about/trust-center/privacy/gdpr/subprocessors.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/about/trust-center/privacy/gdpr/subprocessors.html</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Modification &amp; Enforcement</u>. Trend Micro reserves the right to modify this document at any time without prior notice. Please note these are non-binding service level targets, and while reasonable efforts will be made to achieve these targets, failure to do so is not considered a material breach of any agreement, nor can Trend Micro be held liable, financially or otherwise, on missed targets.</p>
