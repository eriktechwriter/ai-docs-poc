Important Endpoint security policies only support endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent version October 2024 release or later installed. Certain settings require credits to enable. The first time you enable endpoint sensor detection and response, your currently deployed Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent install the new Network Content Inspection Engine. For more information, see Network Content Inspection Engine. Endpoint security policies are a tool you can use to centrally manage endpoint settings for your connected Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent, including agents with Standard Endpoint Protection and Server &amp; Workload Protection installed. The table below details what settings and features you can configure using an endpoint security policy: Setting Description Endpoint sensor detection and response Sends activity data for state-of-the-art threat detection and alerts (required for advanced XDR detections and Workbench alerts) The detection and response feature collects endpoint activity data that helps provide alerts and enhanced investigation data whenever a suspected attack occurs. The collected data is also used by Cyber Risk Exposure Management applications to help identify risky endpoint and user behavior, and to identify endpoint vulnerabilities. Monitoring level Controls the sensitivity of endpoint sensor detections Requires enabling Endpoint sensor detection and response. Raising the monitoring level increases the sensitivity of the endpoint sensor, which increases the number of detections and alerts. Higher levels allow for more strict monitoring to help with situations like on-going threat investigations, but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Some components used by higher monitoring levels are not available on all platforms. The default setting is 2 - Moderate. Trend Micro recommends using the default setting to balance more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints. Important Monitoring level only supports Windows endpoints. Deepfake detector Analyzes ongoing video calls to determine if they contain synthesized images Requires enabling Endpoint sensor detection and response. Important Deepfake detector only supports Windows endpoints. Additional settings for Standard Endpoint Protection and Server &amp; Workload Protection can be configured in the Protection Managers. Central management of agent and component versions is coming soon.

In the Endpoint group field, click the edit icon (). The Select Endpoint Group window appears. Locate and select the endpoint group you want to add. Important Endpoint groups can only be assigned to one policy at a time. Selecting a group that is already assigned to a policy moves that endpoint group to the new policy. Selecting an endpoint group automatically selects any child groups including those already assigned to a policy. You can clear the selection for any child group you do not want to include in the new policy. Child groups can be assigned to a different policy than the parent group. After selecting one or more endpoint groups, click Select. Configure your priority rules. To add a new priority rule, click Add Priority and specify a name for the rule. New rules are automatically added to the top of the priority list as Priority 1. To change the order of your priority rules, click and drag the priority rule you want to change. The priority rule number changes automatically. For example, moving Priority 1 under Priority 3 automatically changes the original Priority 1 to Priority 3, and the old Priority 2 and Priority 3 become Priority 1 and Priority 2, respectively. To change the name of a priority rule, click the options icon next to the name () and select Rename. To delete a priority rule, click the options icon next to the name () and select Delete. Important You cannot delete the Default priority rule. Click the priority rule you want to configure. Configure the General Information settings for the selected priority rule. Important If an endpoint matches multiple priority rule criteria, the endpoint uses the highest priority rule matched. If an endpoint does not match any priority rule criteria, the endpoint uses the Default priority rule. The Default priority rule criteria is All endpoints and cannot be changed. Select the Criteria type. Specify the criteria values. The criteria is used to determine which endpoints within the assigned endpoint groups the priority rule applies to. The criteria value input method changes depending on which criteria type you select. Criteria type Description Input method Endpoint name The priority rule applies to any endpoint containing at least one specified value in the endpoint name For example, if you specify Test, the priority rule applies to the endpoint Test01. Specify a value and either type a comma (,) or press ENTER to separate values. Operating system The priority rule applies to any endpoint with the specified operating system Click the edit icon () to select the OS family or a specific OS version. IP range The priority rule applies to any endpoint with an IP address within one of the specified ranges Specify an IP range in either IPv4 or IPv6 format. Click the add icon () to add up to 3 IP ranges. To add more criteria to the selected priority rule, click Add Criteria and select the criteria type. Priority rules use AND logic when matching multiple criteria. Endpoints must match all defined criteria to apply the priority rule. For example, if Criteria 1 is Windows, and Criteria 2 is a defined IP range, then Linux endpoints within the defined IP range do not apply the priority rule. Important Make sure that you do not create a priority rule that is impossible for endpoints to match. Trend Micro suggests not using the same criteria type more than once in a priority rule. Configure the Sensor Settings for the selected priority rule. Enable the following settings to turn on the features for your endpoint agents. Important Certain settings require credits to enable. The first time you enable endpoint sensor detection and response, your currently deployed Trend Vision One Endpoint Security Agents install the new Network Content Inspection Engine. For more information, see Network Content Inspection Engine. Enabling Endpoint sensor detection and response automatically disables Activity Monitoring on agents managed by Server &amp; Workload Protection. For more information, see Automatic disabling of Activity Monitoring after updating to Server &amp; Workload Protection. Setting Description Endpoint sensor detection and response Sends activity data for state-of-the-art threat detection and alerts (required for advanced XDR detections and Workbench alerts) The detection and response feature collects endpoint activity data that helps provide alerts and enhanced investigation data whenever a suspected attack occurs. The collected data is also used by Cyber Risk Exposure Management applications to help identify risky endpoint and user behavior, and to identify endpoint vulnerabilities. Monitoring level Controls the sensitivity of endpoint sensor detections Requires enabling Endpoint sensor detection and response. Raising the monitoring level increases the sensitivity of the endpoint sensor, which increases the number of detections and alerts. Higher levels allow for more strict monitoring, but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. The default setting is 2 - Moderate. Trend Micro recommends using the default setting to balance more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints. For more information, see About Monitoring Level. If hypersensitive mode is enabled in support settings, you can select Enable hypersensitive mode to enable on endpoints targeted by the priority. Hypersensitive mode automatically disables after seven days. After disabling hypersensitive mode, the priority returns to your previously configured monitoring level.. Important Monitoring level only supports Windows endpoints. Deepfake detector Analyzes ongoing video calls to determine if they contain synthesized images Requires enabling Endpoint sensor detection and response. Important Deepfake detector only supports Windows endpoints.

Put fields that return a large volume of data (such as objectRawDataStr or rawDataStr) at the end of the query string. Avoid using too many wildcards, or put wildcards at the end of the query string. Use only one or two tactics, techniques, and procedures per filter. Use as few operators as possible in a filter. Put the eventSubId at the beginning of the filter conditions to quickly narrow down the dataset. Use processName instead of processCmd to streamline filtering and reduce complexity. Put a simple subset pattern before a complicated pattern (such as complex regex or middle wildcards). Example: For objectRawDataStr:'*(abcd -UseBasicParsing)*' AND (objectRawDataStr: '* abcd *' OR objectRawDataStr: '* efgh *'), extract the longest plain sub-string, which is objectRawDataStr: '*-UseBasicParsing*'. Then add another filter that checks objectRawDataStr: '*-UseBasicParsing*' first. Use full match with exact values instead of partial match.

Backup of customer data follows industry-defined best practices and our various certifications such as ISO 27001 (for access control and cryptography) and ISO 27017 (for monitoring of cloud services and segregation of environments) help define our processes for backup and data recovery.  Customers can choose an available Trend Vision One region to provision the Trend Vision One console, and store and process all data lake services and data. Customers can assign roles to users which limit access rights to Trend Vision One, including but not limited to, granting support access, initiating response actions, collecting files from endpoints, and limiting users to read-only access.  Data at rest is protected by the native cloud technologies in the cloud on which it resides. Customer data is tagged with a “Customer ID” during ingestion as part of the data schema. The internal data access layer of Trend Micro applications requires this “Customer ID” parameter to access the data. This measure protects the customer data from being accessed by any other party as queries may only access one “Customer ID” at a time. Customers do not provide the “Customer ID” directly when interacting with the service; it is handled by the application itself.

Also as part of Trend Micro’s quality assurance process for threat detections, if our threat expert team identifies an alert in your environment that they believe to be critical or interesting, they will work with regional resources to help notify you directly. This will not occur for all alerts, and is at the discretion of the threat expert team as they do not review all alerts for all customers. Correlated detection models Advanced detection models written by Trend Micro threat researchers correlate activities within or across security layers to find undiscovered attacks. The detection models, which generate the alert triggers, combine multiple rules and filters using a variety of analysis techniques including data stacking and machine learning. You can turn on and off individual models as appropriate for the organization’s risk tolerance and preferences. Workbench and alert triage View a list of alerts (workbenches) and drill down for further visibility. Workbenches are the investigation results for a detection, where you can look at the execution profile, identify the scope of impact and take response actions. This is where you prioritize and process the alerts and track what has been done (new, in progress, closed). Attack visualization Quickly understand the story of an attack with an interactive visual representation of events. Advanced analysis is available with: The Execution Profile Analysis view to see the threat actions within an endpoint, server, or cloud workload Network Analysis to replay network communications and see details of an attacker’s command and control communications or lateral movement Search/Threat hunting Proactively search through endpoint, email, network, and cloud workload activity data (for example, telemetry, NetFlow, metadata, etc.) using a simple query builder. Do IoC sweeping or custom searches using multiple parameters and filter down into things by adding additional search criteria. From a search result, you can initiate response or generate an Execution Profile. You can build, save, and reuse queries for basic threat hunting. Built-in threat intelligence Detect threats sooner with automatic searching of your environment with indicators of compromise (IoCs) published by Trend Research. When there is a detection, built-in threat intel can help identify the associated campaign, target platform, associated MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ TTPs, and can even provide links to related intelligence blog posts if available. MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ mapping Mapping of techniques to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework help organizations quickly understand and communicate what is happening in your environment. Hyperlinks from the workbench link to documentation for the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. Integrated response actions Offers contextually aware response choices for quick action taken directly from within the platform, Start your response sooner by “right-clicking” on objects in the workbench or within threat hunting search results. In one location, you can initiate and track endpoint, email, server, and network responses. API integrations A public API can be used by customers to integrate with various SIEM and SOAR tools. Out of the box, Trend Vision One provides a SIEM connector for alerts to be pulled into Splunk. Unlike regular syslog forwarding, this Splunk add-on calls the Trend Vision One API to get the list of alerts (workbenches). Analysts can click on the alert from within Splunk and be taken to the associated workbench in the Trend Vision One platform for additional visibility and investigation. Software-as-a-Service solution Trend Vision One is hosted and managed in the cloud to take advantage of cloud computing technologies. Plus, you do not have the overhead associated with managing local hardware.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Europe - firewall exceptions","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-europe-firewall-exceptions-part","content":"Europe - firewall exceptions Related information Firewall exceptions: Europe - all exceptionsFirewall exceptions: Europe - cloud service extensionFirewall exceptions: Europe - hosted Service Gateway","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Firewall exceptions: Americas - cloud service extension","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-firewall-americas-cloud-service","content":"Firewall exceptions: Americas - cloud service extension The following firewall exceptions apply to networks with a Service Gateway installed and cloud service extension turned on.

The following table outlines considerations you should be aware of before updating. Important Post-update tasks: Verify that your user accounts have the correct access permissions and roles in the new User Accounts app and resolve any role conflicts. Check or establish your identity provider (IdP) connections in the Identity Providers app. Consideration Description Permanent update You cannot undo or stop the update once you begin. Business-level migration The migration is only supported at the business level for each console. Communication interruptions and forced sign-out during update Communication with any associates that access your Trend Vision One console is temporarily terminated as soon as the update process begins. Trend Micro recommends finishing all ongoing tasks before starting the update. After the update completes, you might need to update your user accounts before re-accessing the system. If an account update is required, the affected users receive an email notification with instructions on updating their accounts. Required update of user account sign-in credentials After updating to the Foundation Services release, the owner of the Primary User Account must update the sign-in account to a valid, unused email address. The account owner must also reset their password, and if applicable, their multi-factor authentication (MFA) credentials. All Trend Vision One local accounts receive an email with a link to reset their password, and if applicable, their MFA credentials. note If the email address associated with a Trend Vision One account was previously registered with a Trend Cloud One account, the accounts and sign-in credentials merge. The user can sign in to Trend Vision One with the same credentials used to sign in to Trend Cloud One. After the update, SAML Account and SAML Group Account users are unable to sign in to Trend Vision One until an administrator configures the required identity provider in Identity Providers, and the users verify their sign-in email addresses. Single sign-on (SSO) to licensed Trend Micro solutions After updating to the Foundation Services release, the Primary User Account can automatically sign in via SSO to all licensed Trend Micro cloud services from the console links available in Trend Vision One. For security reasons, these console links are visible only to the Primary User Account. Other Trend Vision One users, including newly accounts created after the update, must access the external consoles via the normal sign-in screens. note Access to any connected on-premises solutions always requires manual sign-in, and all users with permission to the view Trend Vision One apps can view the links. Endpoint agent bandwidth usage If you currently use the toggle-based Endpoint Inventory app, your endpoints automatically download an update package to enable access to new features in the Foundation Services release and Endpoint Security. The download package size can be up to 61 MB depending on your endpoint configuration. To control the amount of bandwidth consumed by your endpoint agents during this process, configure bandwidth throttling settings before updating your console. Updating other Trend Micro products After updating to the Foundation Services release, all existing product connections remain visible in the Product Instance app. To update your other Trend Micro solutions after updating Trend Vision One, select a product instance and begin the update manually.

The following table outlines considerations you should be aware of before migrating your user accounts from Trend Cloud One - Endpoint &amp; Workload Security, Trend Micro Apex One as a Service, Trend Micro Cloud App Security, and Trend Micro Email Security. Updated product Description General considerations for all products All user accounts migrated to Trend Vision One are assigned custom user roles with most of the same permissions and asset visibility scope as before migration. Important Role-based access control and license-related permissions are not carried over to Trend Vision One to avoid privilege escalation. For more information, see User Roles (Foundation Services release). If you need to migrate SAML Accounts and SAML Group Accounts from your other Trend Micro products to Trend Vision One, update to the Foundation Services release and configure the required identity providers in Identity Providers before migrating users. SAML users with unverified email domains are required to verify their email addresses and update their accounts before signing in to Trend Vision One. Migrating Trend Micro Apex One as a Service user accounts to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security After updating to Endpoint Security, local account users must sign in to the Trend Micro Apex One as a Service console and update their sign-in email address and password before signing in to Trend Vision One. note If the email address associated with a Trend Vision One local account was previously registered with a Trend Cloud One account, the accounts and sign-in credentials merge. The user can sign in to Trend Vision One with the same credentials used to sign in to Trend Cloud One. Important SAML Accounts and SAML Group Accounts without valid email addresses cannot be migrated to Trend Vision One. The membership of Trend Micro Apex One as a Service SAML Group Accounts remains exactly the same after migrating to Trend Vision One, and cannot be updated. If you need to update group membership after migration, you must create new SAML Group Accounts in User Accounts. Updating Trend Micro Cloud App Security user accounts to Trend Vision One Email and Collaboration Security After updating to Email and Collaboration Security, all local account users receive an invitation email and must update their account before signing in to Trend Vision One. Local account users can also sign in to the Trend Micro Cloud App Security console and follow the instructions to update their user account. note If a Trend Vision One local account's sign-in email address was previously registered with a Trend Cloud One account, the two accounts merge.

Trend Vision One decides the risk level of an event based on two factors: Likelihood of a successful attack Using global data, Trend Vision One assesses how often events are part of an attack compared to how often they are part of regular situations. A higher malicious activity usually results in a higher risk level. Potential impact Trend Vision One considers the potential damage of an event. The associated risk level is higher when an event is close to causing disruption or incurring costs. For example, in lateral movement events, attackers already control at least one of your endpoints and are trying to move through your environment. In contrast, in initial access events, attackers try to get inside your environment. By analyzing these factors and others specific to the threat assessment framework, Trend Vision One determines the appropriate risk level associated to a security event.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"IBM SOAR integration","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-ibm-soar-integration","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Procedure​","type":1,"pageTitle":"IBM SOAR integration","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-ibm-soar-integration#procedure","content":" In the Trend Vision One console, generate the API authentication token.

Feature Compliance risk Recommendation Standard Endpoint Protection - Data Loss Prevention Standard Endpoint Protection includes Data Loss Prevention (DLP) features that can detect and prevent unauthorized actions with cardholder data. DLP filters logs at the endpoint to retain no more than the first six and last four digits of cardholder data. However, the optional &quot;Forensic Evidence Collection&quot; feature introduces a critical compliance risk. When activated, this feature can capture complete data payloads, potentially including unmasked cardholder data. Disable the &quot;Forensic Evidence Collection&quot; feature. Zero Trust Secure Access - Private Access ZTSA Private Access provides SASE-based VPN services between remote endpoints and internal applications through the use of Private Access Connectors deployed in your corporate environment. Traffic from endpoints to Private Access Connectors is not encrypted by default for traffic sent using an unencrypted protocol. If encryption is not enabled, ZTSA Private Access could potentially transmit cardholder data in an unencrypted format. Enable Encrypt app traffic transmitted using unencrypted protocols in the configurations for your internal applications. Important Encrypting app traffic transmitted using an unencrypted protocol consumes a high amount of system resources and will impact performance when connecting to internal apps. Zero Trust Secure Access - Internet Access ZTSA Internet Access offers a proxy-based service to facilitate secure public internet access for users. The service decrypts all HTTPS traffic by default to enforce policies and conduct security checks, a process that temporarily exposes cardholder data within the proxy infrastructure.

Removing an endpoint from Endpoint Inventory does not uninstall the agent package, regardless if the endpoint was removed manually or automatically by the inactive agent removal settings. The behavior of removing and reconnecting depends on when the endpoint was removed. For endpoints removed before March 25, 2024: After removal, Endpoint Inventory creates a command to disable the endpoint sensor. The next time the endpoint powers on, it receives the disable command and removes the endpoint sensor. The endpoint does not reappear in Endpoint Inventory. To reconnect and enable the sensor, you must download and reinstall the agent package. For endpoints removed after March 25, 2024: After removal, Endpoint Inventory creates a command to disable the endpoint sensor. Additionally, Endpoint Inventory creates a reconnect request. The reconnect request expires after 365 days. The next time the endpoint powers on, it receives the disable command and removes the endpoint sensor. After the removal process completes, the endpoint receives the reconnect request and automatically reinstalls the agent package. The endpoint sensor applies the currently configured general and global settings. After the reinstallation process completes, the endpoint appears in the Endpoint Inventory. note When reconnecting endpoints managed by a Protection Manager, the endpoints might take longer to reestablish their connection to their Protection Manager. While the endpoint is connecting, the endpoint displays the Sensor only status. Allow some time to re-synch with the assigned Protection Manager. If the endpoint does not receive the reconnect request, (for example, the reconnect request expires), you must download and reinstall the agent package to reconnect the endpoint. If you removed an endpoint for the purpose of connecting the endpoint to a different company, you must completely uninstall the agent package before you can install the agent package for the new company.

How an endpoint agent connects to Trend Vision One depends on a combination of priority and availability. Endpoints connect to whichever proxy is both available and has a higher priority. Availability is determined through probing. Agents probe for a connection every 10 minutes. Once a successful connection to a proxy or Service Gateway is established, the agent maintains that connection for the next 10 minutes, even if the proxy or Service Gateway becomes unavailable during those 10 minutes. A proxy or Service Gateways is considered unavailable if the agent connection times out or fails. The endpoint agent has a timeout setting of one (1) minute for each step of the HTTPS request: DNS look-up, TCP connection, HTTPS response. If a connection fails, the agent does not wait for the timeout before attempting to find another available proxy or Service Gateway. Connection failures are caused by events such as being unable to resolve the FQDN, any firewall blocks the request, or the proxy or Service Gateway is down. Endpoint agents use the following priority when determining which proxy to connect to if more than one is available: Proxy Priority Behavior Assigned proxy policy, highest priority criteria match Service Gateway Custom proxy (third party proxy) System proxy (proxy set by the agent OS) Assigned proxy policy, next highest priority criteria match If an endpoint matches the criteria of more than one priority within a proxy policy, it applies the highest priority with a proxy available to connect. Command Line input proxy You can specify a proxy using the command line before or after installation by running the agent installer with the following command: EndpointBasecamp.exe/proxy_server_port &lt;address:port&gt; &lt;address:port&gt; is the proxy server IP address or FQDN and the connection port. Direct connection Last known usable note Endpoint groups can only be assigned to one proxy policy at a time. If an endpoint agent cannot connect using the assigned proxy policy, it does not use the Base Policy. Server &amp; Workload Protection adds additional steps to the proxy priority. If an endpoint agent is not able to connect using a proxy policy or if the endpoint agent resolves to &quot;direct connection&quot; using the above priority list, it instead uses the following priority behavior: Server &amp; Workload Protection agent proxy settings Server &amp; Workload Protection server proxy settings Direct connection","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Runtime Proxy Settings","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-runtime-proxy-settings","content":"Runtime Proxy Settings Configure custom proxy policies for more granular control over how endpoints connect to Trend Vision One.

Click the Add Policy button to create a new policy, or click a policy name to edit an existing policy. For more information, see Configuring Runtime Proxy policies Runtime Proxy Settings allows you to create and manage your proxy settings with greater control and specificity. An individual policy can be applied across multiple groups, as well as having different policies apply to sub-groups within a parent group. The following table describes the information presented on the Runtime Proxy Settings list. Column Description Policy name Your proxy policies listed in order of creation The policy list displays the newest policy first. Click a name to edit the policy. Important Endpoint groups not assigned to a policy apply the Base Policy Currently, sensor-only and connected endpoint protection agents can only apply the Sensor Policy. Trend Micro recommends configuring the Base Policy and Sensor Policy before adding any new proxy policies. Endpoint group Lists the security deployments, Protection Managers, and endpoint groups the policy applies to Endpoint groups can only be the target of one policy at a time, but sub-groups can be a target of a different policy than the parent group they belong to. Priority Lists the priority rules set in each policy A policy can have up to fifteen priority rules plus the base priority. The base priority is always the lowest priority within a policy. Criteria Lists the criteria of each priority within a policy Hover over the number next to the criteria to see a list of the criteria values. For example, if the criteria is &quot;endpoint name&quot; hovering over the number shows a list of the specified values the policy uses to match endpoints to apply that priority. Proxy settings Lists the proxy settings in order of priority Proxy policies always follows the priority of: Service Gateways with Forward Proxy Service enabled, if configured The list displays the specified Service Gateways configured by the policy, or &quot;All Service Gateways&quot; if configured to use any available Service Gateway note Endpoint agents can utilize the following services when enabled on the Service Gateway: General Cache Service: When enabled, the endpoint agent uses the Service Gateway to download agent update packages. ActiveUpdate Service: When enabled, the endpoint agent uses the Service Gateway to download pattern updates. Primary Custom Proxy, if configured The list displays the proxy and port in the format of IP address:Port or FQDN:Port System proxy Agents always default to the system proxy if unable to connect to a Service Gateway or the Primary Custom Proxy.

Oct 2021 Purpose. This SLO is applicable to each Trend Vision One Solution (herein, “Vision One Solution”) that is offered for sale by Trend Micro. This SLO describes certain internal objectives for the delivery of each Vision One Solution and does not apply to any other Trend Micro product or service. Access to and use of each Vision One Solution is subject to acceptance of and agreement to the terms and conditions of the applicable Terms of Use or Terms of Service, as may be applicable, for Vision One Solution(s) as published (collectively, the “Terms of Use”). In the event of any specific conflict between the Terms of Use and those of this Service Level Objectives, the conflicting terms set forth in this Service Level Agreement will prevail. Terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use. Application. This SLO is only applicable to a Vision One Solution customer having a paid right to access and use one or more Vision One Solution(s) as evidenced by such customer having agreed to the Terms of Use for the relevant Vision One Solution that has not expired or been terminated by either party. Definitions “Scheduled Maintenance” means periods of downtime related to network, hardware, or service maintenance or upgrades. Trend Micro will publish notice or notify Company one (1) to two (2) weeks prior to the commencement of each Scheduled Maintenance. “Emergency Maintenance” means unscheduled maintenance periods during which a Vision One Solution may be disrupted or prevented due to non-availability or any maintenance for which Trend Micro could not have reasonably prepared for the need for such maintenance, and failure to perform the maintenance would adversely impact the service. “Service Availability” means access to the web administration console for a Vision One Solution using a web browser, programmatic access using Application Programming Interfaces (API’s), and connectivity between any software portion of the Vision One Solution installed in the customer environment (agents, clients, gateways, network appliances) and the portion of the Vision One Solution hosted on behalf of Trend Micro by its IaaS third party service providers. Conditions of this SLO. The customer must have and maintain an environment that has Internet access in order to use a Vision One Solution. The customer must have and maintain access to a browser application supported by the Vision One Solution to use the Web-based administrative console. The customer understands and agrees that its Vision One Solution security policies and security events are also logged or recorded by the Vision One Solution in the performance of the provided offering as agreed in the Terms of Use. The customer must take all necessary measures to ensure that it and all of its employees are aware of and in compliance with any requirements, responsibilities and limitations set forth in the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, any applicable data privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations, as well as Trend Micro’s Acceptable Use Policy as published in the Terms of Use. Service Availability. Each Vision One Solution is hosted twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week in Trend Micro’s managed public IaaS environment hosted by its third party service providers. Each Vision One Solution systems, networks, and capacity are continually monitored by Trend Micro and its IaaS third party service providers to provide optimal availability and efficiency to Vision One Solution customers. The target Service Availability is 99.9% in each calendar year. Trend Micro uses commercially reasonable efforts to make available each Vision One Solution on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week basis. However, as described in this SLO, each Vision One Service may be unavailable due to scheduled maintenance, unscheduled downtime or unforeseen circumstances including suspension of a Vision One Solution to mitigate any malicious activities, in which event, Trend Micro shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reinstate the Vision One Solution as soon as possible. Trend Micro strives to perform most, if not all, software upgrades without service impact to customers. Periodically, Trend Micro will schedule maintenance of a Vision One Solution by striving to provide customer at least seven (7) days’ notice since such maintenance may cause disruption of that Vision One Solution. Within any Scheduled Maintenance window Trend Micro can announce further extension of the outage period before 30 minutes of the end of the Scheduled Maintenance. An extension cannot exceed the maintenance time by more than 8 hours or double the planned maintenance time (whichever is less) unless a need for Emergency Maintenance arises. Scheduled maintenance shall not exceed more than eight (8) hours per calendar month except as may be imposed by any IaaS third party service providers over which Trend Micro has no control. If at any time the continued availability of a Vision One Solution would compromise the security of such Vision One Solution due, but not limited, to hacking attempts, denial of service attacks, or other activities that may be malicious, due to negligence or misconfiguration, either directed at or originating from a customer’s environment, Trend Micro may temporarily suspend, in part or in whole, Vision One Solution(s) as to such customer and/or other customers. In such an event, Trend Micro will promptly inform affected customer(s) and will work to resolve such issues, reinstating the affected Vision One Solution(s) at the earliest opportunity. Disaster Recovery. Trend Micro maintains, updates, and periodically tests, a disaster recovery plan in connection with each Vision One Solution. Because each Vision One Solution is a Web-based cloud service, there may be Excused Performance Events beyond the reasonable control of Trend Micro that may impact a Vision One Solution as is more fully described in the Terms of Use. The following objectives are provided each Vision One Solution: Recovery Time Objective (RTO) – No more than 5 hours Recovery Point Objective (RPO) – No more than 24 hours. Relationship to Third Parties. As is more fully described in the Terms of Use and documents referenced therein, Trend Micro utilizes the services of third party subprocessors in connection with each Vision One Solution. As such, the provision of Vision One Solution is somewhat dependent on the performance of each such subprocessor, each of which, provides Trend Micro the benefit of its service level agreements. For a list of subprocessors for each Vision One Solution, please visit https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/about/trust-center/privacy/gdpr/subprocessors.html. Modification &amp; Enforcement. Trend Micro reserves the right to modify this document at any time without prior notice. Please note these are non-binding service level targets, and while reasonable efforts will be made to achieve these targets, failure to do so is not considered a material breach of any agreement, nor can Trend Micro be held liable, financially or otherwise, on missed targets.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"ServiceNow ITSM integration (for Workbench)","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-servicenow-itsm-integration","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Procedure​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ServiceNow ITSM integration (for Workbench)","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-servicenow-itsm-integration#procedure","content":" On the Trend Vision One console, go to Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration and click ServiceNow ITSM.

The deployment script performs multiple checks to ensure complete and successful installation of the endpoint agent program. If you are experiencing installation errors, review the following tips to resolve most issues. Make sure you are running the installer with Administration or root privileges. Not having sufficient access rights causes installation to fail. Ensure your operating system has the required utilities to perform the installation. Windows requires the following PowerShell utilities: Invoke-WebRequest: required for downloading tools and agent components Expand-Archive: required for extracting files Linux rquires the following utilities: curl: required for downloading. Must have a version installed that supports TLS v1.2. tar: required for extracting files base64: required for processing the agent configuration For Linux, the installation script automatically detects the OS version. Verify you are installing the agent on a supported Linux operating system. If you are using a proxy for deployment, ensure the proxy is available and able to connect to the internet. Verify the endpoint can connect to the internet and that the connection is stable. The agent installer performs each step of the deployment process one at a time, and waits until the current task is finished before proceeding to the next step. If the installer is unable to successfully complete a task, it might fail due to timeout or when the retry count is exceeded. The agent installer does not perform the registration step until all other installation tasks are successfully completed. If your agent is having trouble connecting and registering to Trend Vision One, check your internet connection and verify that your firewall settings are properly configured.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Middle East and Africa - firewall exceptions","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-uae-firewall-exceptions","content":"Middle East and Africa - firewall exceptions Related information Firewall exceptions: Middle East and Africa - all exceptionsFirewall exceptions: Middle East and Africa - cloud service extensionFirewall exceptions: Middle East and Africa - hosted Service Gateway","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Uninstall Windows Agents with Microsoft Intune","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-uninstall-agents-intune","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Procedure​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Uninstall Windows Agents with Microsoft Intune","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-uninstall-agents-intune#procedure","content":" On the Trend Vision One console, go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Inventory.

Important The Image Setup Tool disables updates for the endpoint agent. To maintain the ability to update the agent program in the future, you must create a snapshot of the source desktop before installing and running the Image Setup Tool. Prepare and export the golden image as normal. For Linux and macOS images, export the source desktop as a golden image template. Your template is now ready to deploy to your virtual machines. Do not continue the following steps. When signing into a desktop created using the golden image template, the newly-provisioned endpoint appears in the Endpoint Inventory list. For Windows images, use the following steps to run the Image Setup Tool and then export the golden image template. Important The Image Setup Tool does not support Linux or macOS images. Continue only for Windows images. In the Trend Vision One console, go to Endpoint Security Operations → Endpoint Inventory and click Agent Installer.

Account Type Description SAML Account Allows you to invite individual SAML users to sign in to the Trend Vision One console using your corporate identity provider solution. SAML Group Account Allows you to invite multiple users in an assigned distribution list to sign in to the Trend Vision One console using your corporate identity provider (IdP) solution. Adding SAML Group Account users requires group information synchronization with your IdP, and users must verify their email addresses before they can sign in to Trend Vision One. IdP-Only SAML Group Account Allows you to add multiple users in an assigned group to sign in to the Trend Vision One console using your corporate identity provider (IdP) solution. An IdP-Only SAML Group Account is a specialized group account utilized in Trend Vision One that only requires your configured IdP to share the SAML group attribution with Trend Vision One, which only allows users assigned with the group attribution to access the Trend Vision One platform based on the configured group's role settings. Because the IdP-Only SAML Group Account does not require sharing or synchronizing other data related to the configured user list, Trend Vision One might not have access to individual user information, and cannot send email notifications to users within the IdP-Only SAML Group Account.

The Asset Visibility Management app allows you to group your organization's data and Trend Vision One app assets in a centralized location. Data assets of your organization that can be managed cover multiple layers, including endpoints, containers, accounts, cloud assets, network assets, and more. Trend Vision One app assets are the settings that the administrators configure and manage in the Trend Vision One console, for example, scheduled playbooks in the Security Playbooks app and custom reports in the Reports app. Large-sized customers that run multiple businesses or have the need to segregate asset data visibility for different teams can leverage this capability to achieve granular data visibility and multi-tenancy management purposes within a single Trend Vision One console. note For customers who have configured scopes for endpoints and containers in User Roles, asset visibility scopes that include newly supported assets are automatically created and associated to the corresponding roles and are given the same role name for easy mapping. By organizing your assets into asset visibility scopes for different businesses, teams, or regions, you can assign the scopes to one or more user roles to determine which assets are visible or manageable to these roles in all applicable Trend Vision One apps that display the data of the selected assets. For more information about creating a custom user role, see User Roles. For example, users having a user role with a specified endpoint visibility scope can view the data of endpoints within their responsibility in not only Endpoint Security Operations but also Search and Cyber Risk Exposure Management, and take actions on these assets if having necessary permissions. At the same time, the users are not able to view data of endpoints outside of their asset visibility scope. note In some Trend Vision One apps, to provide a full landscape of security posture (for example, in Cyber Risk Exposure Management) or attack tracking (for example, in Workbench), users with a specified asset visibility scope can still see assets outside of the scope, but are not able to drill down for further visibility or take actions on these assets.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"What telemetry does the endpoint agent collect from Windows?","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-docs-poc/trend-vision-one-what-telemetry-collect-windows","content":"What telemetry does the endpoint agent collect from Windows?
