# Allow phishing simulation URLs in Microsoft Edge via group policy

Add phishing simulation URLs to the Microsoft Edge Allowed Domains list in Microsoft Entra ID to keep simulation links from triggering Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings.

### Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Administrative access to Microsoft Entra ID

- Permission to configure group policy objects (GPOs)

- Permission to download and install policy files for Microsoft Edge

Adding phishing simulation URLs to the Microsoft Edge Allowed Domains list involves downloading policy files, modifying group policy settings, and applying the changes to make sure simulation links function correctly.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Download the Microsoft Edge policy files.

    1.  Go to the [Microsoft Edge Business Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download) page.

    2.  Scroll to the section labeled "Looking for an older version of Edge?"

    3.  Select the latest options for **Select channel version**, **Select build**, and **Platform**.

    4.  Click **Get Policy Files** to download `MicrosoftEdgePolicyTemplates.cab`.

2.  Prepare the policy files.

    1.  Double-click the downloaded CAB file and extract `MicrosoftEdgePolicyTemplates.zip` to a temporary folder.

    2.  Go to the extracted folder and open `\windows\admx`.

    3.  Copy `msedgeupdate.admx` and `msedge.admx` to `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions`.

3.  Install language-specific templates.

    1.  Return to the extracted folder and go to `\windows\admx\<Appropriate Language>` (for example, en-US).

    2.  Copy `msedge.adml` and `msedgeupdate.adml` to `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\<Appropriate Language>`.

4.  Record the **Security Awareness** sending IP addresses.

    1.  On the Trend Vision One console, go to **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Security Awareness → Phishing Simulations**.

    2.  Click **Settings**.

    3.  Click **Settings** and copy the sending IP addresses and simulation URLs.

        :::warning[Important]

        The sending IP addresses change over time. Check the list before launching a training campaign or phishing simulation.
        :::

5.  Configure the group policy.

    1.  Open the Group Policy Management Editor.

    2.  Go to **Computer Configuration → Microsoft Edge → SmartScreen Settings**.

    3.  Enable **Configure the list of domains for which Microsoft Defender SmartScreen won’t trigger warnings** and click **Show**.

    4.  In the window that appears, add the URLs and IP addresses you copied from Security Awareness Training.

    5.  Click **OK**, then **Apply**, and **OK** again to save and close the settings.

6.  Apply and verify the GPO.

    1.  Link the newly configured GPO to the appropriate Organizational Unit (for example, Domain Controllers).

    2.  On a target device, open a CLI as Administrator and run `gpupdate /force` to apply the GPO to the device.

    3.  Open regedit and go to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\SmartScreenAllowListDomains` to verify the URLs are listed.

    4.  Try to access a phishing simulation URL to make sure the page is accessible and displays correctly.
