# Risky Mobile Apps

View a list of installed mobile apps considered as risky and manage the risky mobile apps.

The **Risky Mobile Apps** tab lists the installed mobile apps that are considered as risky by Trend Micro Mobile Apps Reputation Service.

Trend Micro Mobile Apps Reputation Service is a cloud-based service that automatically identifies mobile threats based on app behaviors. The service uses leading sandbox and machine learning technologies to protect users against malware, privacy leaks, and app vulnerabilities.

:::note

This feature currently supports only Android apps. **Mobile Security** periodically collects identity information of all mobile apps installed on Android devices and matches the information against pattern data in Mobile Apps Reputation Service to identify risky mobile apps.
