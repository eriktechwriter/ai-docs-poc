# Cache Settings for Scans

The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent can build the digital signature and on-demand scan cache files to improve its scan performance. When an on-demand scan runs, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent first checks the digital signature cache file and then the on-demand scan cache file for files to exclude from the scan. Scanning time is reduced if a large number of files are excluded from the scan.
