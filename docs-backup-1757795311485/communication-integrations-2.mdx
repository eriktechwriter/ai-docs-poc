# Communication integrations

Cloud Risk Management offers integration with multiple 3rd party communication tools and major ticketing systems. Each of them can be customized to create multiple channels with varying triggers and notification settings to help fit into your organizationâ€™s own workflow, e.g. alerts to employees responsible for the maintenance of servers.

*FAQ*

***Is the system using API endpoints to integrate with JIRA, ServiceNow, and Zendesk? Can you list down the IP addresses that can be allow-listed?*** Yes, Cloud Risk Management uses the following API endpoints to interact with Jira, ServiceNow ITSM, and Zendesk. You may need to allow-list these IP addresses if your ticketing system is protected by a firewall or limits access based on IP addresses:*us-west-2*(Oregon) 34.210.51.12034.211.72.71 *ap-southeast-2* (Sydney)52.65.53.11454.153.192.180*eu-west-1* (Ireland)34.251.80.17652.214.29.244*ca-central-1* (Canada)15.222.199.2143.96.40.99*ap-southeast-1* (Singapore)54.255.49.22318.139.50.58*eu-central-1, CloudOne Germany (de-1)* (Germany)3.68.155.8635.157.123.83*ap-northeast-1, CloudOne Japan (jp-1)* (Japan)35.72.45.8954.95.48.132

**What happens if I only have automatic notifications turned on for ticketing communication channels (JIRA, ServiceNow, and Zendesk)?**

We will automatically create tickets for the failed checks.

- If the failed check has previously been resolved, we will create a new ticket.
- If there is an unresolved ticket for the same failed check then no new tickets will be created.

**What happens if I only have manual notifications turned on for ticketing communication channels (JIRA, ServiceNow, and Zendesk)?**

We will not automatically create tickets for failed checks, they will need to be created manually (using create ticket button for the check).

- The manual create button will be enabled to create a new ticket if the previous ticket relating to the same failed check has been resolved.
- The open ticket button will be enabled if there is a previous ticket which has not been resolved.

**What happens if both manual and automatic notifications are turned off for ticketing communication channels (JIRA, ServiceNow, and Zendesk)?** We will not change the statuses of any tickets. **When will my tickets be automatically resolved for ticketing communication channels (JIRA, ServiceNow, and Zendesk)?**

We will resolve the tickets where you have either autommatic or manual notifications enabled.
