# Upgrade from Service Gateway 1.0 to 2.0

:Upgrade to Service Gateway 2.0 to manage services more easily and use resources more efficiently.

:::note

This feature is not available in all regions.
:::

Upgrading requires fewer configuration steps than migrating, but results in a longer downtime. All services on the Service Gateway are unavailable during downtime.

Trend Micro recommends [migrating from Service Gateway 1.0 to 2.0](migrating-service-gateway-1-0-2-0.mdx). If an unexpected error occurs during the upgrade process, you could experience an interruption in services and may need to reinstall the server.

:::warning[Important]

To ensure a smooth upgrade, make sure you have configured correct “Allow” rules for the following services in your firewall settings:

- Setting Synchronization for Service Gateway

- Upload Center

To find the FQDNs of these services, refer to the topics under [Service Gateway virtual appliance communication ports](sg-ports-used.mdx) based on your region.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management**.

2.  Click the configuration icon (![](/images/configure=GUID-657DB993-ADC7-4DEC-8C62-C8739D74760E.webp)) for the Service Gateway appliance that you want to upgrade.

3.  Click the **Migration Options** tab.

4.  Click **Upgrade to Service Gateway 2.0**.

5.  Select the services to upgrade and install on Service Gateway 2.0.

    :::note

    Active services used within the last 30 days are selected by default. Services not selected can be installed manually after upgrading.
    :::

6.  Click **Start Upgrade**.

    The upgrade process may take up to an hour. If the process stops progressing:

    - Ensure Service Gateway 1.0 can download the upgrade package by verifying access to the correct FQDNs.

    - Sign in to the Service Gateway from the CLISH and check the displayed version number.

    - Ensure the Service Gateway 1.0 status is healthy. Unhealthy Service Gateway Virtual Appliances must be migrated rather than upgraded.
