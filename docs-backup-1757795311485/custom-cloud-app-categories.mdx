# Custom cloud app categories

Add custom cloud app categories that you can use in secure access rules to allow or deny users' access to specific cloud apps.

Trend Micro provides the Cloud Reputation Services that can identify and categorize cloud applications. Trend Micro experts constantly evaluate, assess, and adjust cloud applications' risk levels based on multiple criteria to ensure that customers always have the latest information.

:::note

Custom cloud app categories can be applied to the following:

- Risk rules

- Internet access rules
:::

Integrated with Cloud Reputation Services, Trend Vision One allows you to group a set of cloud applications based on your corporate compliance, and then add them in Internet Access rules to contain access to these apps.

The following table outlines the actions available on the **Custom Cloud App Categories** tab (**Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Resources → Custom Cloud App Categories**).
