# Upgrade a relay

Before upgrading agents, you can upgrade your relays either through the Server & Workload Protection console or by running the installer manually.

For more information, see [Best practices for upgrades](upgrades.mdx).

## Upgrade a relay from Server & Workload Protection {#upgrade-a-relay-from-server-workload-protection}

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Log in to the Server & Workload Protection console.

2.  Identify your relays byt doing one of the following:

    - Go to *Computers*. In the main pane, look for computers with the relay icon (![](/images/relay_server=ee64af72-a190-4a0a-b332-0bd1bcea02e9.webp)).
    - Go to *Administration*. On the left, click **Updates â†’ Relay Management**. In the main pane, expand a *Relay Group*. Your relays are displayed with the relay icon (![](/images/relay_server=ee64af72-a190-4a0a-b332-0bd1bcea02e9.webp)).

3.  Double-click the relay that you want to upgrade.

4.  Click the *Actions* tab.

5.  Click *Upgrade Agent*.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

Follow the steps in the wizard that appears. Steps are similar to upgrading an agent, since a relay is just an agent with relay functionality enabled. For details, see [Upgrade the agent](upgrade-agent.mdx).

## Upgrade a relay by running the installer manually {#upgrade-a-relay-by-running-the-installer-manually}

Sometimes you may not be able to upgrade the relay software from the Server & Workload Protection console. In these cases, you can upgrade a relay manually. For detailed instructions that are applicable to both agents and relays, see [Upgrade the agent manually](upgrade-agent.mdx).
