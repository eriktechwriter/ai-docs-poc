# Trend Vision One access tiers

:Understand Trend Vision One access tiers and license expiration policies.

You can provision a Trend Vision One console for no additional charge if you hold a valid license for a supported product, a Trend Vision One app, the XDR add-on, or Trend Vision One credits.

:::warning[Important]

The Trend Vision One platform supports the latest versions of the following desktop browsers:

- Google Chrome

- Mozilla Firefox

- Microsoft Edge (Chromium)

The Trend Vision One platform is not officially supported on mobile browsers (Android and iOS).
:::

There are two access tiers available:

- [Essential Access](essential-access.mdx): Trend Micro provisions a Trend Vision One console with Essential Access apps and features to customers with licenses for supported on-premises and SaaS products.

- [Advanced Access](advanced-access.mdx): Trend Micro provisions a Trend Vision One console with a complete suite of apps to customers with Trend Vision One credits or a supported Advanced Access license, such as the Trend Vision One XDR add-on or Zero Trust Secure Access.

The expiration date of the Trend Vision One console aligns with the expiration date of the supported license that expires last, including licenses for Trend Vision One credits. For paid licenses, you receive a notification that your Trend Vision One credits are about to expire 30 days before the expiration date. Once the expiration date arrives, there is a 30-day grace period during which you can access the Trend Vision One console as normal. After the grace period, there is a 30-day lock period during which you are not able to access the Trend Vision One console through browser or API and receive no notifications, but your account is still recoverable. After the lock period, Trend Micro purges all your account data. Renew your license or credits before the end of the lock period to retain your data.

For trial licenses, you receive a notification that your Trend Vision One is about to expire 15 days before the expiration date. Once the expiration date arrives, there is a 30-day lock period. There is no grace period for trial licenses.

:::note

If your credits for [Advanced Access](advanced-access.mdx) expire and you still hold a valid license for [Essential Access](essential-access.mdx), you can continue using Essential Access apps and features until the associated license expires.
