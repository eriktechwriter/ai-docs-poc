# Hide sensitive data in Runtime Security

May 6, 2025—You can now hide sensitive data in the Runtime Security feature in Container Security. This enhancement stops sensitive data leaks within your Runtime Security events, safeguarding your critical information. Concealing sensitive data within these events bolsters your data security and reduces the chances of unauthorized access to confidential information.

For more information, see [Enable Runtime Security and scanning features](runtime-security-scanning-kubernete.mdx).
