# Cloud Accounts official release

September 28, 2023—The Cloud Accounts app is no longer a pre-release feature and is now generally available. Cloud Accounts does not require any credit allocation and is always included as part of Trend Vision One. However, some features managed by the Cloud Accounts app may require credits for use.

Included with this release is integration with Server & Workload Protection for AWS accounts.

- Adding new AWS accounts in the Trend Vision One console are now exclusively handled by the Cloud Accounts app.

- Existing AWS accounts connected to Cloud Accounts are automatically associated with a Server & Workload Protection instance.

- Existing AWS accounts within Server & Workload Protection are automatically added to and can be managed from Cloud Accounts. Update existing AWS accounts from Server & Workload Protection to get enhanced visibility and protection features within their cloud environments.

For more information, see [Cloud Accounts](cloud-accounts.mdx).
