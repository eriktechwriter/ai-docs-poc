# Connecting TippingPoint SMS 5.5.4 or 6.0.0 through a Service Gateway

Connect a TippingPoint Security Management System (SMS) 5.5.4 or 6.0.0 to Network Security through a Service Gateway.

:::warning[Important]

**Intrusion Prevention Configuration** currently only supports policy enforcement on the first TippingPoint SMS connected to Trend Vision One. Support for policy enforcement on multiple TippingPoint SMS deployments is coming soon.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Generate an API key to access the SMS Web API.

    1.  From your SMS interface, select **Admin → Authentication and Authorization → Roles** and verify that the role for the selected user account has the `Access SMS Web Services` capability enabled.

    2.  Select **Admin → Authentication and Authorization → Users**.

    3.  Select the user account, and click **Edit**.

    4.  Click **Regenerate API Key** to get a new API key.

        You can reset the API key for any reason. But when you do, from this point, the previous API key can no longer be used.

2.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management**.

    :::note

    Connecting a TippingPoint SMS using a Service Gateway requires a Service Gateway 2.0 or later appliance. You can check the Service Gateway version in **Service Gateway Management**.
    :::

3.  If you do not have a Service Gateway available for connecting your TippingPoint SMS to Trend Vision One, you must install a Service Gateway appliance .

    :::note

    Multiple TippingPoint SMS deployments can connect to a single Service Gateway appliance.
    :::

    1.  Click **Download Virtual Appliance** to open the **Service Gateway Virtual Appliance** panel.

    2.  Select either **VMware ESXi (OVA)** or **Microsoft Hyper-V (VHDX)** as the disk image type you want to use.

    3.  Click **Download Disk Image**.

    4.  Copy the **Registration Token**, which you will need when deploying the appliance.

    5.  Install the Service Gateway virtual appliance.

        For detailed deployment instructions, see:

        - [Deploying a Service Gateway virtual appliance with VMware ESXi](service-gateway-vmware-esxi.mdx)

        - [Deploying a Service Gateway virtual appliance with Microsoft Hyper-V](sg-appliances-hyper-v.mdx)

        For a complete list of Service Gateway system requirements, see [Service Gateway appliance system requirements](sys-sg-requirements.mdx).

    6.  Click **Close**.

4.  Configure the Service Gateway appliance for use with a TippingPoint SMS.

    1.  Click the name of the Service Gateway appliance.

    2.  Click **Manage Services**.

    3.  Click the install icon (![](/images/SG2_install_icon=GUID-feef28dd-2ddb-4093-b4e4-5455a0b110bb.webp)) to install and then enable the following services.

        <table>
        <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 25%" />
        <col style="width: 75%" />

        <td><p>Required for filter policy distribution and enforcement from Intrusion Prevention Configuration in Trend Vision One to TippingPoint SMS devices</p></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

5.  In the **Service Gateway Management** app, record the Service Gateway Management API key and the IP address of the Service Gateway appliance.

    1.  Click **Manage API Key** and record the API key, then click **Close**.

    2.  Click the Service Gateway appliance name and record the **IPv4 address**.

6.  Configure a TippingPoint SMS connector in Trend Vision One.

    - For customers that have updated to the [Foundation Services release](update-foundation-services-release.mdx), go to **Service Management → Product Instance**.

    - For customers using the legacy Trend Vision One console, go to **Point Product Connection → Product Connector**.

    Alternatively:

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Network Security → Network Inventory**.

    2.  Select the **Continue with TippingPoint** deployment option.

    3.  Click **Connect a TippingPoint SMS**.

    4.  Follow the steps in the connection guide dialog for configuring a Service Gateway (if required), generating an enrollment token using the **Product Instance** app, and connecting your SMS to Trend Vision One using the SMS Client interface.

7.  Connect your TippingPoint SMS to Trend Vision One.

    1.  On the TippingPoint SMS web management console, go to **Administration → Trend Micro Connections**.

    2.  Click **Configure**.

    3.  Paste the enrollment token into the **Enrollment Token** field.

        Using an enrollment token automatically provisions a one-year Trend Vision One certificate. The certificate automatically renews 30 days before expiration to avoid any gaps in security protection.

    4.  Enable and configure the Service Gateway function.

        1.  In the **Service Gateway** section, enable the **State** toggle.

            :::note

            - The **State** toggle is only present in TippingPoint SMS 6.0.0 or later.

            - The Service Gateway function cannot be disabled in earlier versions.
            :::

        2.  In the **IP Address** field, enter the IP address of the Service Gateway.

        3.  In the **API Key** field, enter the Service Gateway Management API key.

        4.  Click **Test Connection** to verify that the TippingPoint SMS can connect to Trend Vision One.

8.  Enable sharing and synchronization between Trend Vision One and your TippingPoint SMS.

    1.  In the **Suspicious Object** section, enable the **State** toggle and specify how often you want the Suspicious Object List to be synchronized in the **Download Interval (minutes)** field.

    2.  In the **Event and Filter Status Sharing** section, enable the **State** toggle.

    3.  In the **Network Intrusion Prevention - Data Sharing** section, enable the **State** toggle.

    :::danger[Warning]

    At least one of the three functions must be enabled before you proceed to the next step. Saving your settings without one of the three functions enabled could render your TippingPoint SMS inoperable.
    :::

9.  Click **Save**.

10. Verify the connection status.

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console:

        - For customers that have updated to the [Foundation Services release](update-foundation-services-release.mdx), go to **Point Product Connection → Product Instance**.

        - For customers using the legacy Trend Vision One console, go to **Point Product Connection → Product Connector**.

    2.  Check that the **Connection status** for TippingPoint Security Management System is green.

    Devices managed by the TippingPoint SMS can be viewed in **Network Security → Network Inventory**.

11. To check for vulnerabilities and receive policy recommendations in Trend Vision One, enable the TippingPoint SMS as an Cyber Risk Exposure Management data source.

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Cyber Risk Overview**.

    2.  Click **Data sources**.

    3.  In the **Trend Micro Security Services** section, click **TippingPoint Security Management System**.

    4.  Enable **Data upload permission** to allow the TippingPoint SMS to provide data for more comprehensive risk insights into your network activity.
