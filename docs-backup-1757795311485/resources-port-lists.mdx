# Port Lists

Configure port lists to manage which ports Web Reputation and Firewall rules monitor.

:::warning[Important]

If you are working on a policy, make sure to save your settings before leaving the screen. Leaving the screen without saving discards any changes.

Port lists are a policy resource used by [Web Reputation](policies-web-reputation.mdx) and [Firewall rules](resources-firewall-rules.mdx) to define which ports you want to monitor. You can add up to 250 port lists.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Policy Resources → Port Lists**.

2.  Create or edit a list.

    - To create a new list, click **Add port list**.

    - To edit an existing list, click the list name and go to **General**

3.  Specify a name and description for the list.

4.  For **Port**, specify a port or port range.

    Ports must be a numeric value between 0 and 65535. Use a hyphen (-) to define a range.

5.  To add more ports, click **Add**.

    You can specify up to 20 items per list.

    :::warning[Important]

    Ports and port ranges cannot overlap. For example, specifying `0-120` and `90` is invalid.
