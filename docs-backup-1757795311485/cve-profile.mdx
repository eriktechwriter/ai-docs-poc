# CVE profiles

View important information regarding a specific CVE detected in your environment and any associated prevention and detection rules available from your integrated products.

CVE profiles provide detailed information regarding the CVEs detected in your organization's environment, the mitigation options available from your Trend Micro products, and any additional reference information for use in further investigation. The type of CVE determines what information is displayed in the profile.

To view the profile of a CVE, go to **Threat and Exposure Management** and select the **Vulnerabilities** risk factor in the **Risk Factors** tab. Then, click the **Vulnerability ID** of the CVE under **Detected Vulnerabilities**. You may also click the open in new tab icon (![](/images/open_in_new_tab_icon=GUID-D37037A0-DD4F-4C8A-AB74-D8793D4F991A.webp)) next to the CVE in **Network Security → Intrusion Prevention Configuration**.

To view the profile of a time-critical CVE, go to the **Exposure Overview** tab in **Cyber Risk Overview** and click **View details** in the corresponding security alert.

The following table details the tabs that can be displayed when viewing the profile screen for a CVE. Displayed tabs vary depending on the types of assets vulnerable to the CVE.

<p>For some supported platforms, Trend Vision One automatically detects completed mitigation actions, sets the CVE status to Mitigated, and removes affected devices from the affected devices list. CVEs on some platforms are not supported for automatic detection, which means any mitigated devices may still remain on the affected devices list. Trend Micro still recommends you to complete mitigation actions on unsupported platforms to strengthen your security posture.</p></td>
