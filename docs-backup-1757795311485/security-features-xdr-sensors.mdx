# Security features and XDR sensors

Review security features and extended detection & response (XDR) sensors to provide coverage and visibility for discovering attack indicators.

The **Security Features** and **XDR Sensors** sections provide an overview of feature coverage within your environment.

:::warning[Important]

**Targeted Attack Detection** requires enabling [Smart Feedback](smart-protection.mdx) on management servers to begin analyzing your Smart Protection Network data.
:::

Enabling *Smart Feedback* and *XDR sensors* improves attack visibility. Enabling *Predictive Machine Learning* and *Behavior Monitoring* enhance security capability.

**Targeted Attack Detection** displays coverage as a percentage. For security features, this is the percentage of management servers in your environment with the feature enabled. For XDR sensors, **Targeted Attack Detection** calculates the percentage according to the number of sensors enabled versus how many sensors you can enable according to your product license or available credits. Increasing coverage provides more data from across your network, allowing for more accurate analysis and monitoring of your environment.

Click security features to view a list of management servers and manage features.

Click XDR sensors to go to the **Inventory** app and manage sensors.
