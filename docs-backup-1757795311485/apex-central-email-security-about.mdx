Trend Micro Apex Centralâ„¢ is a central management console that manages Trend Micro products and services at the gateway, mail server, file server, and corporate desktop levels. The Trend Micro Apex Central web-based management console provides a single monitoring point for managed products and services throughout the network.

Trend Micro Apex Central allows system administrators to monitor and report on activities such as infections, security violations, or virus entry points. System administrators can download and deploy components throughout the network, helping ensure that protection is consistent and up-to-date. Trend Micro Apex Central allows both manual and pre-scheduled updates, and the configuration and administration of products as groups or as individuals for added flexibility.

If Cloud Email Gateway Protection is managed from Trend Micro Apex Central, you can use single sign-on to access the Cloud Email Gateway Protection administrator console and check the connection status of registered Cloud Email Gateway Protection servers.
