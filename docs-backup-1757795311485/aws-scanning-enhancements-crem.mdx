# Upcoming AWS account scanning enhancements for CREM Cloud Risk Management users

April 15, 2025—As a part of our commitment to improving customer experience, we will release significant system enhancements for AWS cloud account scanning. These enhancements will be rolled out gradually over the next several months.

Some upcoming enhancements allow for more thorough and accurate scanning of account resources and verification, which may change the display of particular data with existing inconsistencies.
