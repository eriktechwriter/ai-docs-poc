# Monitor phishing simulations

View the progress or results of your phishing simulations to gain insight into your users' behavior.

After creating a phishing simulation, you can view the simulation details in the **Simulations** tab in **Phishing Simulations**. The tab displays all created simulations, whether the simulations are in progress, completed, cancelled, or scheduled.

Click on the name of a simulation to view the simulation details, where you can monitor the simulation. The following table details the actions you can take on the simulation details screen.
