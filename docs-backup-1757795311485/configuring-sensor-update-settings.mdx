# Configuring sensor update settings

Manage whether your Virtual Network Sensor updates automatically and configure update schedules.

Use the **Sensor Update Settings** screen to enable or disable automatic updates. If you enable automatic updates, you can also configure the update schedule to plan when your deployed Virtual Network Sensors perform updates.

:::warning[Important]

If you disable automatic updates, you must manually trigger the update process for the Virtual Network Sensor. Manually updating always updates to the latest version.

Network Inventory only maintains update support for Virtual Network Sensor versions released within the last six months. Versions older than six months might require redeployment to use the latest version.
