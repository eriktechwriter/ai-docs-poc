# Accounts with excessive privilege

**Accounts With Excessive Privilege** are accounts with permissions settings that are likely to cause additional risk.

The **Accounts With Excessive Privilege** widget displays the number of excessively privileged accounts detected over the past 30 days.

Types of excessive account privilege include:

- [Service account misconfigurations](service-account-misconfiguration.mdx): Service accounts with excessive privileges, or service accounts with more permissions than managing accounts

- [Highly authorized disabled accounts](highly-authorized-disabled-accounts.mdx) : Disabled accounts assigned to highly authorized roles or groups

For detailed information about your excessively privileged accounts, click **View details**.
