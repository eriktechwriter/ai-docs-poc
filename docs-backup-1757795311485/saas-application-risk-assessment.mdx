# Enhanced risk assessment for SaaS applications

January 13, 2025—The **Applications** tab in **Attack Surface Discovery** now displays apps organized into three separate categories: public cloud apps, connected SaaS apps, and local apps. The new categories apply across all ASRM apps. Public cloud apps include all apps your users visit, ranked by reputation. Local apps detected on endpoints and analyzed according to sanctioned status and risk level. Connecting the SaaS apps managed by your organization allows for further risk assessment and analysis to enhance your SaaS security posture management.
