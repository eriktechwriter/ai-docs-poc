# Error: Agent version not supported

The error message "Agent version not supported" indicates that the agent version currently installed on the computer is not supported by Server & Workload Protection.

Although the unsupported agent will still protect the computer based on the last policy settings it received from Server & Workload Protection, we recommend that you upgrade the agent so that you can react quickly to the latest threats. For more information, see [Upgrade the agent](upgrade-agent.mdx).
