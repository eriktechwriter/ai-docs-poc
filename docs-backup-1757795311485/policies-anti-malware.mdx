# Anti-Malware

Configure and manage the Anti-Malware scan settings.

:::warning[Important]

- Policies, Threat Prevention, and the Anti-Malware module are "Pre-release" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- These features are not available in all regions.

- Endpoint Security Policies supports agent version 202507 and later. Assigning policies to older agent versions might cause unwanted behavior or fail. Enabling Anti-Malware on older agent versions might cause scheduled scans to run at UTC+0 rather than agent local time zone.

- Anti-Malware uses several policy resources for configuring scans and exclusions. Configure the resources before configuring Anti-Malware.

  - [Schedules](resources-schedules.mdx) are used for scheduled scans.

  - [Directory lists](resources-directory-lists.mdx) are used for exclusions.

  - [File lists](resources-file-lists.mdx) are used for exclusions.

  - [File extension lists](resources-file-extension-lists.mdx) are used for exclusions.

- Navigating between the security modules or leaving the **Policy Settings** screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click **Save** before leaving the current screen.

- The Agent Interface provides additional settings including scan notifications. For more information, see [Agent Interface](policies-agent-interface.mdx).

Anti-Malware proactively detects and eliminates malware threats by analyzing files, processes, and system activities in real time. Utilizing signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and machine learning, Anti-Malware identifies known and emerging threats, including viruses, ransomware, spyware, and trojans. Anti-Malware also automatically quarantines, deletes, or remediates threats based on severity, keeping systems protected without manual intervention.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To allow Anti-Malware to scan and protect your endpoints, select **Enable**.

2.  Configure the **Monitoring level**.

    **Monitoring level** is the degree of vigilance and strictness applied when detecting and responding to potential threats. Higher monitoring levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends setting your monitoring level to **2 - Moderate** for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints.

    1.  To configure the sensitivity of Anti-malware rules, set the **Detection** level.

    2.  To configure the strictness of response actions, set the **Prevention** level.

        :::warning[Important]

        The **Prevention** level must be equal to or lower than the **Detection** level.
        :::

3.  To allow the agent to actively scan folders and endpoint resources commonly targeted by threats, select **Enable real-time scan** under **Scan settings**.

4.  To enable a regular scan of the endpoint, add a schedule to the schedule list.

    :::warning[Important]

    Anti-malware currently only supports one schedule at a time. If you need to change the schedule, select a new schedule, unlink (![](/images/UnlinkIcon=cd49c720-c38e-48c3-8f38-f121a08be544.webp)) the current schedule, then add a new one.
    :::

    1.  To add a new schedule, click **Add schedule**.

    2.  In the **Select schedule** window, select [the schedule you configured in policy resources](resources-schedules.mdx) to use for Anti-Malware scans.

    3.  Click **Select**.

    4.  To remove a schedule, click the **Unlink** icon (![](/images/UnlinkIcon=cd49c720-c38e-48c3-8f38-f121a08be544.webp)).

5.  To exclude certain files and directories from Anti-Malware scans, manage the **Scan exclusions**.

    :::warning[Important]

    Anti-malware currently only supports selecting one of each type of list at a time. You can change the list at any time or manage the following lists in Policy Resources:

    - [Directory lists](resources-directory-lists.mdx)

    - [File lists](resources-file-lists.mdx)

    - [File extension lists](resources-file-extension-lists.mdx)

    You can also specify trusted programs to exclude from all security scans in [Exclusions](policies-exclusions.mdx).
    :::

    1.  To manage your selected exclusion lists, click **Manage exclusions**.

    2.  To exclude a list of file directories, select a **Directory list** you configured in policy resources.

    3.  To exclude a list of files, select a **File list** you configured in policy resources.

    4.  To exclude a list of file extensions, select a **File extension list** you configured in policy resources.

    5.  Click **Save**.
