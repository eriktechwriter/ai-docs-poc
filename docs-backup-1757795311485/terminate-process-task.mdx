# Terminate Process task

After identifying a suspicious or malicious process running on an endpoint, you can terminate the process using context menus on the Trend Vision One console.

This task is supported by the following services:

- Trend Vision One

  - Windows agent

:::warning[Important]

Trend Micro recommends blocking the suspicious process using the User-Defined Suspicious Object List before sending the *Terminate* command to prevent endpoints from restarting the terminated process.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  After identifying the suspicious process, access the context or response menu and click **Terminate**.

    The **Terminate Task** screen appears.

2.  Confirm the targets of the response.

    :::warning[Important]

    This task is only available for certain operating systems. You can only select endpoints running compatible operating systems.
    :::

3.  Specify a **Description** for the response or event.

4.  Click **Create**.

    Trend Vision One creates the task and displays the current task status in **Response Management**.

5.  Monitor the task status.

    1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation â†’ Response Management** .

    2.  (Optional) Locate the task using the **Search** field or by selecting **Terminate** from the **Action** drop-down list.

    3.  View the task status.

        - **In progress** (![](/images/in_progress=GUID-A55897DB-3DEA-4F5C-B7F9-70B3D7FB9EDE=1=en-us=Low.webp)): Trend Vision One sent the command and is waiting for a response.

        - **Queued** (![](/images/queued=GUID-65C0DF81-E50D-4D51-9602-2E9B7A0E5F14=1=en-us=Low.webp)): The managing server queued the command because the agent was offline.

        - **Successful** (![](/images/successful=GUID-1E31AD86-DE2E-48B5-85F7-7C78A3E8BB11=1=en-us=Low.webp)): The command was successfully executed.

        - **Unsuccessful** (![](/images/error=5cc21722-7ceb-480c-b9c2-a47d420cf1cc.webp)): An error or time-out occurred when attempting to send the command to the managing server, the agent is offline for more than 24 hours, or the command execution timed out.

        :::warning[Important]

        - The **Task status** indicates whether the managing server was able to successfully receive and execute the command. If the command target is a Security Agent, the **Task status** does not necessarily indicate whether the target Security Agent or object successfully executed the command.

        - To prevent endpoints from restarting terminated processes, block the object using the User-Defined Suspicious Object List.
