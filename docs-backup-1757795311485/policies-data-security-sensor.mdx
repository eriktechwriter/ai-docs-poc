:::

Data Security Sensor sends activity data to trace and analyze the movement of sensitive data defined by [data policies](data-policy-overview.mdx). Data Security Sensor monitors local assets and devices for sensitive data in the [Data Inventory](data-inventory.mdx). Data Security Sensor also traces the movement of sensitive data to create a Data Lineage graph viewable in Observed Attack Techniques and Workbench.

For more information, see [Data Security](data-security-overview.mdx).

To protect your data with Data Security Sensor, select **Enable**.
