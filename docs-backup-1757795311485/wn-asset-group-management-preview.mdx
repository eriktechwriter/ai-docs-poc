# Define the structure of your organization with Asset Group Management

October 8, 2024—The new Asset Group Management app is now available in public preview. In Asset Group Management, you can create groups of assets, designate tag values for the new Asset group tag, and assign a tag value to each asset group. By enabling you to analyze and manage specific subsets of assets, asset groups streamline your asset management and provide a foundation for powerful new features on the Trend Vision One platform.
