:::warning[Important]

<p>Trend Micro recommends allocating at least an additional 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB memory to your ECS cluster node size on top of your existing requirements before enabling the Runtime Security feature. This is a general-purpose recommendation and can be adjusted based on cluster node size and observed CPU and memory usage. See <a href="trend-vision-one-adjust-cpu-memory-ecs">Adjust the CPU and memory allocations for ECS clusters</a> for more information.</p>

<td><p>Provides visibility of operating system and open source code vulnerabilities that are part of containers running in clusters.</p>


:::warning[Important]

<ul>
<li><p>Vulnerability Runtime Scanning supports clusters with pure ARM64 CPU nodes or pure x86_64 CPU nodes. Mixed CPU modes are not supported.</p></li>
<li>A vulnerability scan occurs for each newly-deployed image, and then is rescanned every 24 hours.</li>
<li><p>Vulnerability Runtime Scanning occurs on all active images inside the ECS cluster, including both ECR and non-ECR images.</p></li>
<li><p>Container Security scans containers in an ECS cluster on a schedule (every 5 minutes). After finding a new uncached image, Container Security posts a scan request to the scan queue, which triggers a SBOM generation in the scan Lambda. This SBOM is uploaded to AsaaS for a vulnerability scan.</p></li>
