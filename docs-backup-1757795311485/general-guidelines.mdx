# General guidelines

Custom filters are YAML files with key-value pairs that define patterns and conditions to detect events. Each file can only contain one filter.

Follow these guidelines when creating custom filters:

- Indent four spaces for data.

  Example:

  ```bash
  detection:
      operation:
          eventname: 'string'

  ```

- Use lowercase characters for keys.

  Example:

  ```bash
  title:
  id:
  description:
  ```

- Use underscores instead of spaces for file names.

  Example:

  `file_name`

- Ensure the file extension is `.yml`.

  Example:

  `possible_brute_force_attack.yml`
