# Configure a custom model

Create a custom model to define the specific events that trigger Workbench alerts.

:::warning[Important]

You can create a maximum of 50 custom models.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Agentic SIEM & XDR → Detection Model Management → Custom Models → Add**.

2.  Specify the general settings of the model.

    - **Model name**

    - **Description**

    - **Severity**

      :::warning[Important]

      Selecting a severity of **Medium** or higher affects the Risk Index in Cyber Risk Overview and Threat and Exposure Management.

      During testing and tuning of the model, select a severity of **Low** to avoid inadvertently affecting your indexes.
      :::

3.  Select the filtering mode for the model.

    There are three filtering modes:

    - **Single Filter**: The custom model applies only one filter.

    - **Multiple filters**: The custom model applies multiple filters using either an AND or OR logical operator.

    - **Multiple filters in sequence**: The custom model applies multiple filters in the specified order.

4.  Specify the filter settings:

    - **Filter name**: the filter the custom model uses

      :::note

      [Create custom filter](creating-custom-filter.mdx) opens **Custom Filter Settings** in a new browser tab. After creating the new custom filter, you can select the filter from **Filter name** in **Custom Models**.
      :::

    - **Threshold**: the number of events that must occur to trigger an alert. The threshold must be greater than 0.

5.  If you selected **Multiple filters** or **Multiple filters in sequence**, you can add another filter by clicking **Add filter**.

    You can have up to five filters. Each filter has an independent threshold setting.

6.  If you selected **Multiple filters**, select the logical operator:

    - **AND**: The model triggers an alert only when all filters meet the specified thresholds

    - **OR**: The model triggers an alert when any filter meets the specified threshold

    :::warning[Important]

    You can only use one operator for all filters. You cannot mix operators between filters.
    :::

7.  Specify the event grouping.

    - **Company**: Trigger an event when the threshold is met anywhere in your organization.

    - **Endpoint**: Trigger an event when the threshold is met and associated with a single endpoint. The event includes only the 10 endpoints with the most matched events.

    - **User account**: Trigger an event when the threshold is met and associated with a single user account.

    To reduce alert fatigue, Workbench alerts only include the top targets with matched events. For example, if you group by `Endpoint`, alerts include only the top 10 endpoints with the highest number of matched events.

8.  Specify the model schedule.

    - **Frequency**: How often the model queries the activity data

    - **Period**: The span of time that is queried each time the model is used

      If the period greater than the frequency, the filter is applied to previously queried data. This might cause the same event to appear in multiple alerts.

    - **Status**: Whether to enable the custom detection model after saving the settings.

9.  Click **Save**.

When enabled, custom models continuously search for matched events.
