You have the ability to choose whether new rules are turned on automatically or manually.

2.  Select:

    - **New rules enabled by default**: to ensure that all new rules are enabled by default when they are released.

    - **New rules are any rules introduced after** - to ensure that any rules released after this set date are treated as new rules.

3.  Click **Save new rules behavior**.

    :::note

    - New rules that are not automatically enabled by default will need to be manually enabled to become active.

    - For newly added cloud accounts, we compare the account creation date with the Rule release date. If the account creation date is after the Rule release date, we do not consider them for the New rules behaviour and all new rules are enabled for the newly added account.
