- **Security Threats Over Time**: Provides a graphical representation of threat information based on the time of the detection and whether the detection occurred on an assigned endpoint or the user's account

  - Hover over a threat icon (for example, ![](/images/icon_malware=GUID-8F7D6D8C-7F89-4294-B6B1-E0C2E1C8EBC7=1=en-us=Low.webp)) to view details about the detection.

  - Change the end date by scrolling through the dates displayed under the graph.

  - Apply filters by clicking the funnel icon (![](/images/icon_funnel=GUID-72793B76-BFB7-45AB-BCA5-AA61DBF5AB9E=1=en-us=Low.webp)) and selecting the following criteria and using the **OR** or **AND** operators to build advanced filters.

    - **Threat type**: Select a threat category from the second drop-down list

    - **Security threat**: Type a malware name or suspicious URL, IP address, or sender email address

    - **Threat status**: Select **Resolved by product**, **Action required**, or **Resolved manually**

- **Security Threat Details**: Provides more detailed information about the threats displayed on the **Security Threats Over Time** graph

  - Click a value in the **Security Threat** column to view the **Affected Users** screen.

    For more information, see [Affected Users](affected-users-apex.mdx).

  - Click **View** link in the *Details* column to view detailed information.

  - Click a flag icon in the *Threat Status* column (![](/images/threat_status_col=GUID-FFEEEEF6-1166-4FD4-8ECC-C61436D268A8=1=en-us=Low.webp)) to change the threat status for threats that require remediation.

    :::note

    Changing the threat status for a threat does not actually resolve the threat. The threat status is a case handling tool to help administrators track identified threats and indicate to other administrators that a threat has been resolved.
