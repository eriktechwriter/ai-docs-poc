# ICAP Protocol and Containerized Scanner

### Introduction to ICAP Protocol {#introduction-to-icap-protocol}

The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) is a lightweight HTTP-like protocol designed for content inspection and modification. ICAP allows proxy servers to offload specific content processing tasks to dedicated servers, creating a more efficient division of labor. Standardized in RFC 3507, ICAP operates on port 1344 by default and follows a client-server model where ICAP clients send content to ICAP servers for processing.

### Containerized Scanner with ICAP Server {#containerized-scanner-with-icap-server}

The Vision One File Security containerized scanner implements an ICAP server that receives files from ICAP clients, scans them for malware and other threats, and returns the scan results. This solution can be deployed in Kubernetes environments using Helm charts, making it flexible for both cloud and on-premises deployments.

Key features:

- Scalable container-based architecture
- Kubernetes-native deployment
- Integration with Trend Vision One for advanced threat intelligence

### Common Use Cases for ICAP Clients {#common-use-cases-for-icap-clients}

1.  Web Proxy Integration:

    - Proxy servers like Squid can be configured as ICAP clients to scan all web traffic

    - Files downloaded by users are automatically scanned before delivery

2.  Email Gateway Security:

    - Email servers can use ICAP clients to scan attachments

    - Malicious files are blocked before reaching recipients' inboxes

3.  File Server Protection:

    - Network file servers can scan files during upload/download operations

    - Prevents malware from spreading through shared storage

4.  Content Management Systems:

    - CMSs can validate uploaded content before publishing

    - Ensures all user-contributed files are safe

5.  Custom Applications:

    - Software developers can integrate ICAP clients into their applications

    - For example, a document processing pipeline that validates files before processing
