# Application discovery is available for Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access

Application discovery identifies domains and IP addresses accessed over the past 14 days, helping you determine which internal applications are being used in your organization's network. To facilitate the configuration of access rules, this feature also identifies users who have accessed the internal applications and recommends the most likely user groups.
