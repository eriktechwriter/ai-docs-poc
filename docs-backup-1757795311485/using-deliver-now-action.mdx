# Using the deliver now action

Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides two options for the **Deliver Now** action:

- Deliver the email message to the default mail server

  If you choose this option, Cloud Email Gateway Protection delivers the email message to the default mail server without executing any more policy rules for the affected email message.

  By default, all policy rules are automatically ordered for security and execution efficiency. Administrators are relieved of determining the order of policy rule execution. This option bypasses the automatic order of execution so that Cloud Email Gateway Protection can deliver the email message immediately.

  :::danger[Warning]

  This option of **Deliver now** is not recommended for use as the only action. If you choose this option of **Deliver now** as the only action for spam, for example, all of that email message will simply be delivered to your recipients, as if there were no spam filter in place.

  If you use this option of **Deliver now** with a malware policy rule, ensure that you also have a **Delete** action for the malware policy rule. Only the **Delete** action takes higher priority than this option and so would be processed before it (and then terminate the processing of that policy rule).

  If you chose this option of **Deliver now** as the only action for a malware policy rule, email messages containing malware would leak through unblocked.

- Deliver the email message to a specific mail server

  If you choose this option, Cloud Email Gateway Protection delivers the email message to the specific mail server that you have configured. This option is recommended if you have a secure messaging server on your network that can process or handle the message.

  :::note

  Cloud Email Gateway Protection can track an email message only before it is delivered. After the delivery, the message is no longer traceable as it is not under the control of Cloud Email Gateway Protection.
