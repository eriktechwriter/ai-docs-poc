# About Server & Workload Protection hardening

Server & Workload Protection runs on Amazon Linux. The Server & Workload Protection team has hardened it based on the [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/) (CIS) standard for Amazon Linux.

Hardening involves making changes to secure the system and make it less vulnerable to attack. For Server & Workload Protection, the changes included updating the web installer so that it terminates after Server & Workload Protection is online, removing unnecessary software, and configuring system settings to use the principal of least privilege, wherever it is applicable.

Additionally, you can:

- [Set up multi-factor authentication](user-accounts-foundation-services.mdx)
- [Manage trusted certificates](manage-trusted-certificates.mdx)
- [SSL implementation and credential provisioning](ssl-implementation-credentials.mdx)
