# Corporate Network Locations

Define your corporate networks on the Internet Access Cloud Gateway or through Internet Access On-Premises Gateways to identify your internal users and apply more granular Secure Access Rules.

The Internet Access Cloud and On-Premises Gateways use your corporate network locations to help identify your internal users' internet traffic. You can use these locations to create specific HTTPS inspection and Secure Access Rules for branch offices or departments, and define rule enforcement schedules based on time zones specified for these locations.
