<p>Enabling remote support permits Trend Micro support engineers to access your Trend Vision One console for troubleshooting and debug log collection, including the following task types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow Trend Micro support engineers to collect the diagnostic package from Endpoint Security.</li>
<li>Allow Trend Micro support engineers to remotely deploy utilities to endpoint agents for troubleshooting and mitigation.</li>
</ul>


:::note

<p>Diagnostic Package Collection in remote support is automatically enabled for new Endpoint Security users.</p>
<p>The diagnostic package is stored using Azure Cloud storage in the US region and is deleted after 21 days.</p>

<p>Hypersensitive mode might generate false positive detections and increase bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>Endpoint Sensors only support hypersensitive mode on Windows agents.</p>
