# Overview section of the computer editor

The computer editor *Overview* page has the following tabbed sections:

- General tab
- Actions tab
- System Events tab
- Exceptions tab

### General tab {#general-tab}

- *Hostname:* Appears in the *Name* column on the *Computers* page. The name must be either the IP address of the computer or the hostname of the computer. Either a fully qualified hostname or a relative hostname can be used if a hostname is used instead of an IP address. You have to specify a hostname that can be resolved or a valid IP address that Server & Workload Protection can access. This is because the communication between Server & Workload Protection and the agent computers are based on the hostname. For relay-enabled agents, all of the computers within the relay group should be able to reach the specified IP address or hostname. If Server & Workload Protection cannot access the target computer the communication direction should be set to Agent/Appliance Initiated (Settings \> Computer).

- *Display Name:* Appears in the Display Name column and in brackets next to the Hostname value.

- *Description:* a description of the computer.

- *Platform:* Details of the computer's OS will appear here.

- *Group:* The computer group to which the computer belongs appears in the list. You can reassign the computer to any other existing computer group.

- *Policy:* The policy (if any) that has been assigned to this computer.

  :::note

  Keep in mind that if you unassign a policy from a computer, rules may still be in effect on the computer if they were assigned independently of the policy.
  :::

- *Asset Importance:* Server & Workload Protection uses a ranking system to quantify the importance of security events. Rules are assigned a severity level (high, medium, low, etc.), and assets (computers) are assigned an "asset importance" level. These levels have numerical values. When a rule is triggered on a computer the asset importance value and the severity level value are multiplied together. This produces a score which is used to sort events by importance. (Event ranking can be seen in the *Events* pages.) Use this *Asset Importance* list to assign an asset importance level to this computer. (To edit the numerical values associated with severity and importance levels, go to **Administration → System Settings → Ranking**.)

- *Download Component Updates From:* Use the dropdown list to select which relay group the agent on this computer will download component updates from. (not displayed if agent is acting as a relay.)

### Computer status {#computer-status}

The Status area displays the latest available information about the computer and the protection modules in effect on it. Whether the computer is protected by an agent is displayed in the top row.

- *Status:*
  - When the computer is unmanaged the status represents the state of the agent with respect to activation. The status will display either "Discovered" or "New" followed by the agent state in brackets ("No Agent/Appliance", "Unknown", "Reactivation Required", "Activation Required", or "Deactivation Required").
  - When the computer is managed and no computer errors are present, the status will display "Managed" followed by the state of the agent in brackets ("Online" or "Offline").
  - When the computer is managed and the agent is in the process of performing an action (e.g. "Integrity Scan in Progress", "Upgrading Agent (Install Program Sent)", etc.) the task status will be displayed.
  - When there are errors on the computer (e.g., "Offline", "Update Failed", etc.) the status will display the error. When more than one error is present, the status will display "Multiple Errors" and each error will be listed beneath.

### Protection module status {#protection-module-status}

Protection modules are deployed to agents on an as-needed basis. Only core functionality is included when an agent is first installed.

The *Status* area provides information about the state of the Server & Workload Protection modules. The status reflects the state of a module on the agent as well as its configuration in Server & Workload Protection. A status of "On" indicates that the module is configured in Server & Workload Protection and is installed and operating on the agent.

A green status light is displayed for a module when it is "On" and working. In addition, modules that allow individual rule assignment must have at least one rule assigned before they will display a green light.

- *Anti-Malware:* Whether Anti-Malware protection is on or off and whether it is configured for real-time or on-demand scans.
- *Web Reputation:* Whether Web Reputation is on or off.
- *Device Control*: Whether Device Control is on or off.
- *Firewall:* Whether the Firewall is on or off and how many rules are in effect.
- *Intrusion Prevention:* Whether Intrusion Prevention is on or off and how many rules are in effect.
- *Integrity Monitoring:* Whether Integrity Monitoring is on or off and how many rules are in effect.
- *Log Inspection:* Whether Log Inspection is on or off and how many rules are in effect.
- *Application Control*: Whether Application Control is on or off.
- *Scanner (SAP)*: Status of the Scanner SAP feature.
- *Online:* Indicates whether Server & Workload Protection can currently communicate with the agent.
- *Last Communication:* The last time Server & Workload Protection successfully communicated with the agent on this computer.
- *Check Status:* This button allows you to force Server & Workload Protection to perform an immediate heartbeat operation to check the status of the agent. Check Status will not perform a component update of the agent. When manager to agent communications is set to "Agent/Appliance Initiated" the *Check Status* button is disabled. Checking status will not update the logs for this computer. To update the logs for this computer, go to the *Actions* tab.
- *Clear Warnings/Errors:* Dismisses any alerts or errors on this computer.

### Actions tab {#actions-tab}

### Activation {#activation}

A newly-installed agent needs to be "activated" by Server & Workload Protection before policies, rules, requests for event logs, etc. can be sent to it. The activation procedure includes the exchange of SSL keys which uniquely identify Server & Workload Protection and an agent to each other.

Agents can only be deactivated locally on the computer or from Server & Workload Protection. If an agent is already activated, the button in this area will read *Reactivate* rather than *Activate*. Reactivation has the same effect as activation. A reactivation will reset the agent to the state it was in after first being installed and initiate the exchange of a new set of SSL keys.

### Policy {#policy}

When you change the configuration of an agent on a computer using the Server & Workload Protection console (apply a new Intrusion Prevention rule, change logging settings, etc.) Server & Workload Protection has to send the new information to the agent. This is a "Send Policy" instruction. Policy updates usually happen immediately but you can force an update by clicking the *Send Policy* button.

### Agent Software {#agent-software}

This displays the version of the agent currently running on the computer. If a newer version of the agent is available for the computer's platform you can click the *Upgrade Agent* button to remotely upgrade the agent from the Server & Workload Protection console. You can configure Server & Workload Protection to trigger an alert if new versions of the agent software are running on any of your computers by going to the **Administration → System Settings → Updates** tab.

:::note

Before updating or uninstalling an agent or relay on Windows, you must disable agent self-protection. To do this, on the Server & Workload Protection console, go to **Computer editor → Settings → General**. In *Agent Self Protection*, and then either deselect *Prevent local end-users from uninstalling, stopping, or otherwise modifying the Agent* or enter a password for local override.
:::

### Support {#support}

The *Create Diagnostic Package* button creates a snapshot of the state of the agent on the computer. Your support provider may request this for troubleshooting purposes.

If you have lost communication with the computer, a diagnostics package can be created locally. For more information, see [Create a diagnostic package](create-diagnostic-package-logs.mdx).

### System Events tab {#system-events-tab}

For information about events, see [System events](system-events.mdx).

### Exceptions tab {#exceptions-tab}

### USB Device Exception rule count limitation {#usb-device-exception-rule-count-limitation}

The current supported USB device exception rule count for each computer is 1000.
