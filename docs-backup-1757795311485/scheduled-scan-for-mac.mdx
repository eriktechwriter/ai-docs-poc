# Scheduled Scan

Scheduled Scan runs automatically on the appointed date and time. Use Scheduled Scan to automate routine scans on the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent and improve scan management efficiency.

Configure and apply Scheduled Scan settings to one or several Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents and groups, or to all Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents that the server manages.
