# XDR Data Explorer

Construct powerful query strings to pinpoint the data or objects in your environment that you want to examine.

**XDR Data Explorer** provides various filters along with a query language to efficiently identify, categorize, and retrieve query results. You can automate the process by [saving queries, configuring the Watchlist](saved-queries.mdx), and [configuring email notifications](notifications.mdx) when you find new data.

The following table outlines the actions available in XDR Data Explorer (**Agentic SIEM & XDR â†’ XDR Data Explorer**).
