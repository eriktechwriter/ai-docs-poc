# Getting started with Endpoint Security Policies (unified assignment)

Get an overview on how to create and assign policies to your endpoint groups.

Endpoint Security Policies (unified assignment) expands the management capabilities of your policies to include configuring security features for Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection. By modularizing security features and certain configurable elements, you can create policy resources that you can reuse across multiple policies.

:::warning[Important]

- If this is your first time using the new Endpoint Security Policies, please read [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx). This version of Endpoint Security Policies is an updated and improved version which integrates most features from Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection. However, support for some features is still under development. Review [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx) to avoid any potential interruption to your security environment.

  To verify which version of Endpoint Security Policies you are using, look for the **Assignments** and **Policies** tabs. If you do not see the tabs, see [Endpoint Security Policies](sensor-settings-policies.mdx).
