# 1.4.2 - Ensure that the –bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Do not bind the scheduler service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface.

:::note

By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0.
:::

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler
```

Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Edit the Scheduler pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter.
