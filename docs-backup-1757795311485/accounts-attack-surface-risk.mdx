# Accounts that increase attack surface risk

**Accounts That Increase Attack Surface Risk** are user accounts with configuration settings that make the accounts more vulnerable to cyber attacks.

The **Accounts That Increase Attack Surface Risk** widget displays the number of accounts detected with settings that increase your organization's attack surface risk over the past 30 days.

Types of risky accounts include:

- [Synced admin accounts](synced-admin-accounts.mdx): Highly authorized admin accounts synced between Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory

- [Extra admin accounts](extra-admin-accounts.mdx): Potentially unnecessary admin accounts

- [Stale accounts](stale-accounts.mdx): Accounts that have been inactive for over 180 days

For detailed information about detected risky accounts, click **View details**.

The following table outlines the sections available on the details screen.
