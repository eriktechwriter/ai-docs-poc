Profile applicability: Level 1

Encrypt etcd key-value store.

etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any disclosures.

:::note

By default, `--encryption-provider-config` is not set.
:::

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--encryption-provider-config` argument is set to a `EncryptionConfig` file. Additionally, ensure that the `EncryptionConfig` file has all the desired `resources` covered especially any secrets.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a EncryptionConfig file. Then, edit the API server pod specification file` /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--encryption-provider-config` parameter to the path of that file:

```bash
--encryption-provider-config=</path/to/EncryptionConfig/File>
```
