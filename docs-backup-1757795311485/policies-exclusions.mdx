# Exclusions

Configure and manage the Exclusions module settings.

:::warning[Important]

- Policies and the Exclusions module are "Pre-release" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- These features are not available in all regions.

- Exclusions uses program lists for configuring the Trusted programs list. Configure [program lists](resources-program-lists.mdx) in policy resources before configuring Exclusions.

- Configuring Exclusions impacts other security modules. Carefully review your settings before saving.

- The Endpoint Sensor does not support the **Trusted programs list**.

- Navigating between the security modules or leaving the **Policy Settings** screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click **Save** before leaving the current screen.
:::

The Exclusions module manages exceptions used across endpoint protection features. Exclusions prevents any specified rule ID or trusted program from security scans and monitoring detections.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To exclude certain rules from security scans, configure the **Rule exceptions**.

    1.  Click **Add rule**.

    2.  Specify the **Rule ID** for the rule you want to exclude.

        Rule IDs can be located by viewing event logs and copying the following fields:

        - For gray detection file-triggered logs, use the `malName` value.

        - For gray detection behavior-triggered logs, use the `ruleName` value.

        - For Behavior Monitoring, use the `ruleId` or `ruleName` value.

2.  To exclude programs you trust from scans and lockdown mode, select a **Program list** under **Trusted programs list**.
