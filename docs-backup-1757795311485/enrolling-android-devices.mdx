        :::note

        Trend Micro recommends using an account set up for work or business. Keep in mind that the account you use should be one that is easily shared or transferred in case the person setting up the managed Google Play connection leaves the company or moves teams.

        If you do not have a Google account for business, sign in to your managed Google Play and create an account by selecting **For work or my business**.
