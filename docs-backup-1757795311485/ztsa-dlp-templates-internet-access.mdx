# Zero Trust Secure Access adds customized DLP templates for Internet Access

June 19, 2023—To strengthen the data loss prevention capability of Internet Access, Zero Trust Secure Access supports customized Data Loss Prevention (DLP) templates and customized DLP data identifiers including expressions, file attributes, and keywords. Administrators can add customized DLP templates using either predefined or customized DLP data identifiers, create DLP rules to include customized DLP templates, and then apply them to Internet Access rules to scan outbound web traffic against accidental data disclosure and intentional theft.

For more information, see [Data loss prevention rules](data-loss-prevention-rules.mdx).
