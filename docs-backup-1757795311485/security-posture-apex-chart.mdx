# Security Posture Chart

The chart on the **Security Posture** tab displays the relationship between the critical threat ratio and compliance level of your network. The x-axis indicates the ratio of critical threats to total endpoints within a site or reporting line. The y-axis indicates the compliance levels of the sites or reporting lines for the selected compliance indicator. You can use this data to quickly identify high risk users and groups from an integrated Active Directory structure.
