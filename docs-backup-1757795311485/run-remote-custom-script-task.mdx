# Run Remote Custom Script task

Execute a PowerShell or Bash script on a target endpoint during an investigation.

Remote custom scripts allows Master Administrator and Security Analyst roles to directly access target endpoints to run a previously uploaded PowerShell and Bash script files.

The following services this task:

- Trend Vision One

  - Linux agent

  - macOS agent

  - Windows agent

- Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security

  - Linux agent

  - macOS agent

  - Windows agent

:::warning[Important]

The following recommendations apply only to PowerShell scripts executed on Windows endpoints:

- The target endpoint's PowerShell execution policy must be set to `RemoteSigned`, otherwise the script may be blocked. RemoteSigned is the default execution policy.

- Trend Micro recommends you configure the PowerShell session language mode to `FullLanguage`, otherwise the script may be blocked. `FullLanguage` is the default language mode for default sessions on all versions of Windows except for Windows RT.

- The script file must not include interactive functions. Because scripts run in silent mode, interactive functions will cause scripts to time out.

  For an example of a signed script, see [Sample signed PowerShell script](sample-signed-powershell-script.mdx).

- Running processes that involve graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is prohibited. This is because the script operates in the service's logon session making it impossible to display windows in the user session due to security concerns.

To learn more about the above settings, please consult the [Microsoft PowerShell official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  After identifying the endpoint to investigate, select **Run Remote Custom Script** from the context or response menu. You can execute only one custom script file per session. The target endpoint must be online to connect successfully.
