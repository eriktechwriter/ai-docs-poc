# Asset relationship visualizations emphasize risk management

February 26, 2024—In line with enhancements to the visualization of asset relationships in **Attack Surface Discovery**, the asset graph feature in profile screens for [devices](device-profile.mdx), [accounts](account-profile.mdx), [domains](domain-profile.mdx), and [IP addresses](ip-address-profile.mdx) has been renamed to Asset Risk Graph, while the graph view for [cloud assets](cloud-assets.mdx) is now the [Cloud Risk Graph](cloud-risk-graph.mdx). Both of these features continue to provide valuable risk findings, helping you assess your organization's security posture.
