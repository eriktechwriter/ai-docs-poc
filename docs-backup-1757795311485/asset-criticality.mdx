# Asset criticality

Asset criticality indicates the importance of an asset to your organization's operations.

An asset is considered critical if compromise of the asset causes severe consequences such as business interruption.

Cyber Risk Exposure Management uses criticality information to calculate asset risk scores. Two assets with the same risk events and different criticality levels are not assigned the same risk scores and should therefore be managed differently.

When assigning criticality levels, Cyber Risk Exposure Management considers significant profile tags derived from data collected by connected sources. Asset criticality levels are evaluated daily.

You can manually assign a custom criticality for assets if you think that the system-defined value is inaccurate. When viewing the criticality of an asset, click **Modify Criticality** to select a custom criticality. You may also select one or more assets from the asset list to modify the criticality of multiple assets. You can revert to using the system-defined criticality at any time.

:::warning[Important]

Connect to as many data sources as possible so that Cyber Risk Exposure Management can obtain the profile tags required to determine asset criticality. For more information, see [Configure Cyber Risk Exposure Management data sources](configuring-data-sources.mdx).

The following table outlines the main asset criticality concepts.

<li><p>Medium-criticality assets are important to your organization's operations and may attract the attention of threat actors. Compromise of such assets can cause some business impact, but not to the same degree of severity as compromise of high-criticality assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Low-criticality assets have minimal operational value and do not require close monitoring. Compromise of such assets usually has minor effects on infrastructure and business operations.</p></li>
