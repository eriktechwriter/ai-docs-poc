# Configured reports

:Users can create customized views of the rules and checks on their accounts, groups, and organizations using [filters](filter-search.mdx). These report configurations can then be saved and scheduled to be generated at a set time each week, to cater to the specific requirements of a team, manager, or administrator. For example, you can create a daily notification sent to a specific set of email recipients that is filtered on Severity and only created in the last 24hrs.
