# Rule updates

:View, manage, and rollback rule updates.

The **Rule Updates** screen provides a list of the most recent Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection Rules downloaded to the Server & Workload Protection database. You can view details for updates or delete, rollback, and export rule updates. To access the list, go to **Administration → Updates → Component → Rules**.

:::tip

To check which rule update version a relay is distributing, go to **Computers**, double-click the relay, and go to **Updates**. If Anti-Malware is enabled, the pattern version for that computer is also displayed.

If your Server & Workload Protection Manager is enrolled in version control policies, the relay displays the currently assigned update policy.

Component update packages must have a valid digital signature. If you try to view or use an invalid package (including old component updates that don't have a signature), then Server & Workload Protection displays an error message. See [How Server & Workload Protection validates update integrity](upgrades.mdx).
