# 1.1.13 - Ensure that the default administrative credential file permissions are set to 600 (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the `admin.conf` file (and `super-admin.conf` file, where it exists) have permissions of 600.

As part of initial cluster setup, default kubeconfig files are created to be used by the administrator of the cluster. These files contain private keys and certificates which allow for privileged access to the cluster. You should restrict their file permissions to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the file(s). The file(s) should be readable and writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, `admin.conf` and `super-admin.conf` have permissions of 600.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.

```bash
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

On Kubernetes version 1.29 and higher run the following command as well.

```bash
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/super-admin.conf
```

Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

On Kubernetes 1.29+ the `super-admin.conf` file should also be modified, if present.

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/super-admin.conf
```
