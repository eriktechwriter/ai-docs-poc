# Review the summary

Get an overview of the detected network events associated with the target node and associated objects.

The **Summary** displays the severity, number of detected internal hosts, number of indicators of compromise (IOCs), and attack patterns, as well as provides a high-level overview of the malicious activity of the correlated event.

You can export the summary data as a CSV file or in a printer-friendly format. Click **Export** and choose the format you want to use.

:::note

If you applied an advanced filter in the Correlation Graph, the exported report only contains the filtered information.

The summary includes various details about the network activity and provides actions you can take to investigate the event.
