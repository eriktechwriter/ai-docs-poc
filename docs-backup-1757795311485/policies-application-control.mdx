# Application Control

Configure and manage the Application Control module settings.

:::warning[Important]

- Policies, Access Control, and the Application Control module are "Pre-release" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- These features are not available in all regions.

- You can configure Application Control rules in policy resources. Configure your [Application Control rules](resources-application-control-rules.mdx) before configuring Application Control.

- Navigating between the security modules or leaving the **Policy Settings** screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click **Save** before leaving the current screen.

- The Agent Interface provides additional settings including access violation notifications. For more information, see [Agent Interface](policies-agent-interface.mdx).
:::

Application Control continuously monitors your endpoints for software changes and allows or blocks software actions based on your enforcement settings, enabled rules, suspicious object list, and trusted program list.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To protect your endpoints with Application Control, select **Enable**.

    :::note

    When you enable Application Control, the rule list might be filtered by **Active** status and might appear empty. Change the **Status** filter to **All** to view the Application Control rules.
    :::

2.  To only allow previously installed applications on the endpoint to run and block all others, select **Enable** under **Lockdown mode**.

    :::warning[Important]

    Lockdown mode strictly blocks any software which might alter the software running on your endpoint. Enabling lockdown mode might block essential functions like Windows Update and the [agent uninstaller tool](uninstalling-agents.mdx). For more information, see [Prepare for Lockdown Mode](lockdown-mode.mdx).
    :::

3.  To configure which Application Control rules the agent enforces, locate the rules you want to use and click to change the status to **Active**.

    :::note

    You can set a maximum of 350 rules to **Active** status.
