# Trend Threat Intelligence Feed

Integrate Trend Threat Intelligence Feed via application programming interface (API) to significantly enhance your security posture by receiving real-time updates on emerging threats and threat actors.

Trend Threat Intelligence Feed is a sophisticated and meticulously-curated threat intelligence source. Harnessing the power of Trend Micro global threat research, machine learning, and analysis, Trend Threat Intelligence Feed continuously provides up-to-date information about emerging threats and threat actors. Leveraging the feed via API into your existing security infrastructure allows your organization to stay one step ahead of cyber threats and maintain a robust and adaptive security environment.

The threat intelligence feeds are now enhanced with advanced contextual information, incorporating threat report names, campaigns, intrusion sets, malware, tools, common vulnerability and exposures (CVEs), targeted industries, and targeted countries. This enrichment provides a more comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of the threat landscape.
