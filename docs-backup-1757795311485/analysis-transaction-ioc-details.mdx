# Analysis using Transactions and IOCs

Investigate security events by reviewing detected transactions and indicators of compromise.

The **Transactions and IOCs** section provides information about transactions and indicators of compromise (IOCs) from the **Correlation Graph**.

Transactions are listed in order of detection, with the oldest transactions first.

IOCs are listed by highest risk level first. IOCs with matching risk levels are then listed in order of detection, with oldest detections first.

Click on a correlation line, internal host, external host, or other object in the correlation graph to filter the transactions and IOCs to those related to the selected line or object.

Some objects in a transaction or IOC allow you to take additional actions to investigate the event. Hover over the actions icon (![](/images/dddna_graph_icon_plus=GUID-674BF3B2-46AB-4463-AEB9-658F8598E69D=2=en-us=Low.webp)) to view a list of available actions.
