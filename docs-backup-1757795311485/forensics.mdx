# Forensics

Respond to security incidents, conduct compromise assessments, threat hunting, and monitoring directly within Trend Vision One.

**Forensics** lets you conduct security investigations without the need for separate digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tools. **Forensics** has no deployment steps and adds no operational complexity.

From the Trend Vision One console, you can gather digital evidence from endpoints, organize the collected evidence data within workspaces, and triage endpoints using osquery and YARA.

The following table outlines the sections available in **Forensics** (**Agentic SIEM & XDR â†’ Forensics**).
