# AWS deployment architecture

Get an overview of how the Cloud Accounts stack fits into your environment and how data is shared with Trend Vision One.

The diagrams below provide an abstract visualization of how the deployment stack fits into your AWS cloud account. Additionally, these diagrams show the flow of information between related AWS assets and how that data is shared with Trend Vision One to power cloud security features.

For details about the resources used and deployed to your AWS environment, see [Resources deployed by Cloud Accounts](resources-deployed-cloud-accounts.mdx).

## Cloud Accounts core features and stack deployment {#cloud-accounts-core-features-and-stack-deployment}

When deploying the Cloud Accounts stack to your AWS account, the stack creates IAM policies and roles to allow Trend Vision One to connect with your account. Additionally, nested stacks are deployed based on the features you enable.
