# Importing and Exporting Policies

Export policies for backup or to import to another Trend Micro Apex Central server of the same version.

:::note

- Trend Micro Apex Central exports policy settings but not policy targets.

- A parent policy stays as a parent after the export or import.

- A child policy becomes a parent after the export. Consequently, it is a parent after the import.

- Trend Micro Apex Central cannot import a policy if its name is the same as an existing child policy. If the existing policy is not a child, Trend Micro Apex Central overwrites it after the import.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Management**.

    The **Policy Management** screen appears.

2.  Select the type of product settings from the **Product** list.

    The screen refreshes to display policies created for the selected managed product.

3.  To export, select one or several policies, click **Export Settings**, and then save the resulting policy file.

    - If you exported a single policy, the resulting file has the extension `*.cmpolicy`.

    - If you exported several policies, the resulting file is a compressed (`*.zip`) file containing the individual `.cmpolicy` files.

4.  To import, click **Import Settings** and then locate and load the policy file.

    - You can import an entire `*.zip` file or import individual `*.cmpolicy` files one by one.

    - If the policy already exists in the policy list, a confirmation prompt appears, asking if you want to overwrite the existing policy.

      Click **OK** to proceed.

    The screen refreshes and displays the imported policy at the top of the list.
