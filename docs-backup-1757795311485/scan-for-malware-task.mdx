# Scan for Malware task

Scan one or more endpoints for file-based threats such as viruses, spyware, and grayware.

This task is supported by the following services:

- Standard Endpoint Protection

- Trend Micro Apex One as a Service

When searching for suspicious files on endpoints, you may trigger a one-time malware scan for a single endpoint using the context menu in **Workbench** or for up to 200 endpoints using the **Response** drop-down menu in **Endpoint Inventory**.

:::warning[Important]

- Agents on target endpoints must be connected and upgraded to the latest version.

- If the agent on a target endpoint is disconnected, the task is queued until the agent reconnects. Queued tasks time out after 24 hours.

- Depending on number of files, size of files, and storage device speed on target endpoints, the task may take several hours to complete.
