# Template-based playbooks

Learn about creating template-based playbooks to automate and orchestrate your response to security incidents.

Trend Vision One comes with a set of predefined playbook templates. The templates provide a ready-to-use workflow that can be quickly set up to meet your needs. Some playbook templates have a fixed workflow, while others are fully customizable.

Playbook templates themselves cannot be executed. You need to create a playbook from them. Multiple playbooks can be created from the same template.

Playbook templates consist of [various node types](playbook-nodes.mdx) that allow you to trigger execution, define the target of the playbook, handle conditions, and carry out actions.

You can view the list of currently available playbook templates from the **Templates** tab in the **Security Playbooks** app.
