# Filter cases by who created or closed them

May 2, 2025—New Created by and Closed by fields and filters in Case Management allow you to view cases based on whether they were opened or closed by a security playbook, Trend Vision One user, or third-party ticketing system. With these fields, you can easily assess the effectiveness of automation and analyst performance for reporting accuracy and informed operational decisions.
