title: Add Global Rules
---
Global rules allow you to enforce and track block rules that have a global scope over all protected computers in your network. Currently, this feature is only available for block rules. Generally, use the following steps to create global rules:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Create and configure an `ApplicationControlGlobalRule` object.

2.  Use an `ApplicationControlGlobalRuleApi` object to create the global rule on Server & Workload Protection.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

Also see the [Create and add new global rules](https://automation.trendmicro.com/cloudone/workload-security/) operation in the API Reference. For more information about global rules, see the [Use the API to create shared and global rulesets](api-shared-global-rulesets.mdx) .

The following example adds software to the Global Rules.

[source](https://github.com/deep-security/automation-center-sdk-samples/blob/master/python/src/application_control_examples.py)

```bash
# Create the rules
new_rules = []
for sha256 in sha256_list:
    new_rule = api.ApplicationControlGlobalRule()
    new_rule.sha256 = sha256
    new_rules.append(new_rule)

# Add the rules
global_rules_api = api.GlobalRulesApi(api.ApiClient(configuration))
rules_list = api.ApplicationControlGlobalRules()
rules_list.application_control_global_rules = new_rules
return global_rules_api.add_global_rules(rules_list, api_version)
```
