# Threat Detection Results Widget

This widget displays the number of threat detections and the ratio of threats compared to the total number of detections. The widget can display data for only one information type at a time. Clicking links in the **Detections** column opens a screen that displays detailed information. Apex Central performs a log query to provide the detailed information.
