# Trusted Program List

You can configure Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents to skip scanning of trusted processes during Real-time Scan and event recording. After adding a program to the Trusted Program List, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent does not subject the program or any processes initiated by the program to Real-time Scan and event recording. Add trusted programs to the Trusted Program List to improve the performance of scanning on endpoints.
