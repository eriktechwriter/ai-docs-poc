# Configure Anti-Malware Monitoring Level

::::warning[Important]

Monitoring Level only supports agent version 20.0.1.25770 and later. Unsupported versions use the default level of **2 - Moderate** and cannot be changed.

Support for Linux agents is limited to 64-bit (x86-64) and 32-bit (x86) systems. Agents deployed to other Linux architectures use the default level of **2 - Moderate** and cannot be changed.
:::

The **Anti-Malware Monitoring Level** setting allows you to set the sensitivity of the anti-malware scan and the strictness applied when responding to potential threats. Higher levels allow for more strict monitoring to help with situations like on-going threat investigations, but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance.

Because of the potential impact on endpoint performance and the generation of additional detection logs, Trend Micro recommends using the default setting of **2 - Moderate**. Only use the higher levels if you are investigating an on-going threat, or if instructed by your support provider.

:::tip

If you want Anti-Malware Scan and Behavior Monitoring to exclude certain detection rules, you can add the rule ID to the Rule Exceptions list by going to the **Anti-Malware â†’ Advanced** tab of the Computer or Policy editor. You can find rule IDs by viewing events in Events & Reports. For more information, see [Create Anti-Malware exceptions](create-anti-malware-exceptions.mdx).
