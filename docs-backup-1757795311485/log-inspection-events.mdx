### What information is displayed for log inspection events? {#what-information-is-displayed-for-log-inspection-events}

These columns can be displayed on the log inspection events page. You can click *Columns* to select which columns are displayed in the table.

- *Time*: Time the event took place on the computer.

- *Tag(s)*: Any tags attached with the event.
- *Description*: Description of the rule.
- *Rank*: The ranking system provides a way to quantify the importance of events. By assigning "asset values" to computers, and assigning "severity values" to log inspection rules, the importance ("rank") of an event is calculated by multiplying the two values together. This allows you to sort events by rank.
