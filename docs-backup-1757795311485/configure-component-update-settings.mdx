# Configure component update settings

Enable automatic patching and updates and configure the alert threshold for delayed updates.

You can configure automatic updates for rule patches and Anti-Malware engine updates. You can also configure alerts in case your endpoint agents fail to apply component updates within a specified time limit. Use the following steps to configure your automatic component updates settings for Server & Workload Protection.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Enable automatic patches for rules.

    1.  Go to either **Computers** or **Policies**.

    2.  Open the computer or policy you want to configure.

    3.  Go to **Settings → General**.

    4.  Under the section **Send Policy Changes Immediately**, locate **Automatically send Policy changes to computers** and select **Yes**.

        Selecting **No** requires rule updates to be manually downloaded and applied.

    5.  Click **Save**.

    6.  Go to **Administration → System Settings → Updates**.

    7.  Under the section **Rules**, select **Automatically apply Rule Updates to Policies**.

2.  Enable automatic Anti-Malware engine updates.

    :::warning[Important]

    Relays always receive the latest Anti-Malware engine updates regardless of the configured settings. This ensures the local protection and engine update source for the same relay group is up to date. Updates cannot be enabled or disabled directly on a relay.

    1.  Go to either **Computers** or **Policies**.

    2.  Open the computer or policy you want to configure.

    3.  Go to **Settings → General**.

    4.  Under the section **Engine Update**, locate **Automatically update anti-malware engine** and select **Yes**.

    5.  Click **Save**.

    6.  If the setting is disabled, go to **Updates**.

    7.  Under **Component Updates** in the **Anti-Malware** table, locate **Advanced Threat Scan Engine**.

    8.  Verify the **Is Latest** status displays **N/A**.

3.  Configure alert settings for pending or late component updates.

    If an agent downloads an update but has not applied the update after a set duration, the system generates an alert. For pattern updates, the default setting is one hour.

    1.  Go to **Administration → System Settings → Alerts**.

    2.  Locate **Length of time an Update can be pending before raising an Alert** and select the time limit in days.
