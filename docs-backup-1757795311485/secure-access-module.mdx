# Secure Access Module

Deploy the Secure Access Module to supported endpoints or mobile devices and manage the deployment status in the Trend Vision One console.

Before deploying the Secure Access Module, install the endpoint agent on target endpoints or the Mobile Agent on target mobile devices. The Secure Access Module functions as a separate app on endpoints and a feature of the Mobile Agent on mobile devices.

The Secure Access Module authenticates users when they sign in and then controls their access to internal apps and the internet based on configured secure access rules. By default, the Secure Access Module authenticates users to both Internet Access and Private Access simultaneously when both solutions are available.

:::warning[Important]

Make sure you have configured SAML single sign-on under **Administration â†’ Identity Providers**. Trend Vision One works with your SAML-based IAM vendor to authenticate your company's users when they use the Secure Access Module.

<p>You may be able to resolve some issues by attempting to deploy or remove the module again, or by updating the endpoints to later operating system versions. For other issues, contact your support provider.</p>

<li><p>Require an additional authentication for users to connect to Private Access while both Private Access and Internet Access solutions are enabled. Only supported for Secure Access Module versions later than 2.8.1369 (Windows) or 2.8.615 (macOS).</p>


:::tip

<p>By default, users connect to both Internet Access and Private Access when signing in to the Secure Access Module. Requiring an additional authentication to Private Access ensures that Private Access is available only on demand.</p>


:::

</li>
<li><p>Configure the authentication method for the Secure Access Module.</p>


:::warning[Important]

<p>Browser-based authentication only supports Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, and Duo for SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication. Using an unsupported identity provider automatically switches the authentication method to module-based authentication.</p>

<li><p>Select how the Secure Access Module sends traffic from user devices for Internet Access.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Windows service modes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Adaptive mode (Default)</strong>: Allows the Secure Access Module to switch between supported modes based on network conditions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Localhost proxy</strong>: Forces all Internet Access traffic to go to the local host</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TUN (Wintun)</strong>: Allows for greater traffic throughput than the TUN (TAP-Windows) service mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TUN (TAP-Windows)</strong>: Provides a functional Internet Access service mode for devices that have compatibility issues with both the Wintun virtual adapter and the localhost proxy</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>macOS service modes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tunnel (VPN)</strong>: Sends traffic through the VPN configured on the device</p>


:::note

<p>The Tunnel (VPN) mode for macOS requires users to allow VPN configurations on their devices.</p>
