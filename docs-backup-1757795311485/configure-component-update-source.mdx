# Configure the component update source

Trend Micro recommends using the default configuration for most security environments. To customize the settings, use the following steps to configure the component update source:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration → System Settings → Updates**.

2.  Select an option for the **Primary Component Update Source**.

    The default primary source is **Trend Micro Update Server**, which agents access using the Internet. Do not select **Other update source** unless instructed by your support provider. Alternative update source URLs must include `http://` or `https://`.

3.  Configure the **Secondary Source** for component updates. Usually, agents connect to a relay to obtain component updates when Server & Workload Protection tells them to. But if your computers can't always connect with Server & Workload Protection or relays (such as during scheduled maintenance times) and enough Internet/WAN bandwidth is available, these options are useful:

    Agents normally connect to a relay to retrieve component updates depending on your Server & Workload Protection configurations. Select the following options to retrieve component updates if agents are unable to connect to your relays or Server & Workload Protection.

    - **Allow Agents/Appliances to download component updates directly from Primary Component Update Source if Relays are not accessible**

    - **Allow Agents/Appliances to download component updates when Workload Security Manager is not accessible**

    :::tip

    Trend Micro recommends not enabling Secondary Source options for protected laptops and portable computers to avoid potential issues when updating components while away from support services.

4.  Select **Automatically apply Rule Updates to Policies** to ensure existing security rules apply the updates to assigned policies.
