# Configure rules for friendly accounts

### What are friendly accounts in Cloud Risk Management? {#what-are-friendly-accounts-in-cloud-risk-management}

A Friendly account is the one that is allowed to access resources on another account because it is trusted. Once a Friendly account is added to the relevant rules, it will result in a success check after a Cloud Risk Management Scan scan.

Account Administrators explicitly allow specific actions or behaviours for friendly accounts. These accounts may have access to a limited set of functionality deemed safe by the administrator.

For example:

AWS *Account A* has access to resources in AWS *Account B*. Both accounts may or may not be owned by the same company or *Account A* might just "*trust*" the *Account B* from AWS console.

In this case, *Account B* would be a friendly (trusted) account to *Account A* as determined by the customer. Therefore certain rule failures caused by *Account B* are excluded from the check.
