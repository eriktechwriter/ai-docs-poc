Create a custom DLP template for use in secure access rules.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Data Loss Prevention Templates** screen, click **Add**.

2.  Type a template name that does not exceed 256 characters.

3.  Type a description that does not exceed 256 characters.

4.  Define a condition statement for this template's data identifiers.

    1.  Select a data identifier and click **Add**.

        If you selected an expression, type the number of occurrences, which is the number of times an expression must occur before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a rule.

        To manage data identifiers, click **Manage Data Identifiers**.

    2.  Choose a logical operator for each definition.

        :::note

        Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements. Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results. For examples of correct usage, see [Condition statements and logical pperators](condition-logical-operators.mdx).
