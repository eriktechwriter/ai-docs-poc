# New macOS Support for Vulnerability Assessment

June 3, 2023—Trend Vision One Vulnerability Assessment now includes support for macOS. This enhancement allows you to:

- Detect known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in macOS applications and operating systems.
- Automatically enable Vulnerability Assessment on macOS endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent installed.
- Connect additional third-party data sources for increased visibility into vulnerabilities in macOS assets.

This update ensures comprehensive vulnerability management across all major operating systems, enhancing your organization's security posture. To learn more about supported macOS versions and applications, see [Vulnerability Assessment supported operating systems](vulnerability-assessment-os.mdx) and [Vulnerability Assessment supported macOS applications](dvass-macos-applications.mdx).
