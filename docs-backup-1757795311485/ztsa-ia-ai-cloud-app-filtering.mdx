# Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access supports Artificial Intelligence category for cloud app filtering

July 3, 2023—Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access now supports a new cloud app category "Artificial Intelligence" evaluated by Cloud Reputation Services. This allows you to easily filter out generative AI-based cloud apps when adding [custom cloud app categories](custom-cloud-app-categories.mdx) and create Risk rules and Internet Access rules to control users' access to these cloud apps.
