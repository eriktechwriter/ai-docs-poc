# Communication recipients

While configuring [Email communication](email-communication.mdx) and [SMS communication](sms-communication.mdx), you can select users who will receive notifications from the recipients list. The list is populated with users who have access to the account for which the communication settings are getting configured, and have at least Read Only access.
