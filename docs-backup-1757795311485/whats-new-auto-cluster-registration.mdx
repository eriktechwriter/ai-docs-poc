# Automated cluster registration in Container Security

January 31, 2025—Trend Vision One now offers automated cluster registration so that you can add many Kubernetes clusters without a repetitive installation flow. Automated cluster registration allows you to use a single Trend Vision One API Key to register all your Container Security clusters, which helps automate the deployment of Container Security protection.

For more information, see [Obtain an API key for automated cluster registration](obtain-apikey-auto-cluster-reg.mdx).
