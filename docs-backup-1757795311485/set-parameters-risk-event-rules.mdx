# Set parameters for risk event rules

September 9, 2024—You may now set specific parameters for the risk event rules for certain risk event types in Threat and Exposure Management. Add IP addresses, apps, rules, or days of the week as conditions that must be met for the risk event rule to apply. Setting parameters allows for more granular control over when a risk event rule is triggered.
