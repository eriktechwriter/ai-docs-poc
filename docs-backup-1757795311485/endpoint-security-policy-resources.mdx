Policy Resources provides a central location to create, manage, and configure settings that are reusable across your Endpoint Security Policies. Policy Resources includes rules, lists, schedules, and authorization tokens. There are several actions you can take depending on the resource type.

:::note

Some actions are not available for every resource. Authorization tokens have a different set of actions. For more information, see [Authorization tokens](resources-authorization-tokens.mdx).

Trend Micro provides pre-defined lists for some resource types. Pre-defined lists cannot be modified or deleted.
