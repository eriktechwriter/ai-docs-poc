# Global Settings

Configure inactive agent removal, bandwidth throttling, and proxy settings that apply to all your deployed agents.

The Global Settings screen features three tabs used to configure various endpoint settings. You can access the Global Settings screen from Endpoint Inventory by clicking the **General and Global Settings** icon (![](/images/Global_Settings=GUID-1E10BFBD-3AFF-46DD-B853-0438EC2FD3F9.webp)) and then clicking **Global Settings**.

<p>The proxy settings on this tab are used when deploying the endpoint agent, allowing it to connect and register to Trend Vision One. Once deployment and registration are complete, the endpoint uses the <strong>Runtime Proxy Settings</strong> for normal operation.</p>

<p>Endpoints prioritize connections via Service Gateway appliances over other proxy settings.</p>
