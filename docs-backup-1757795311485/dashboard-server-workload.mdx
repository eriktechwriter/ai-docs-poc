# Dashboard

The dashboard is the first page that appears after you access Server & Workload Protection (**Endpoint Security Operations → Server & Workload Protection → Dashboard**).

Each user can customize the contents and layout of their dashboard. Server & Workload Protection automatically saves your settings, and will remember your dashboard the next time that you log in. You can also configure the data's time period, and which computer's or computer group's data is displayed.

### Date and time range {#date-and-time-range}

The dashboard can display data from either the last 24 hours, or the last seven days.

### Filter by tags {#filter-by-tags}

In Server & Workload Protection, a *Tag* is a unit of meta-data that you can apply to an Event in order to create an additional attribute for the Event that is not originally contained within the Event itself. Tags can be used to filter Events in order to simplify the task of Event monitoring and management. A typical use of tagging is to distinguish between Events that require action and those that have been investigated and found to be benign.

The data displayed in the Dashboard can be filtered by tags:

For more information on tagging see [Apply tags to identify and group events](apply-tags-identify-group-events.mdx).
