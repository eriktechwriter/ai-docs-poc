# Observed Attack Techniques

Review the individual events detected in your environment that might trigger a Workbench alert.

Trend Vision One detects events through use of granular predefined or custom detection filters that make up the detection models that trigger alerts. Events that Trend Vision One lists on Observed Attack Techniques might not result in a Workbench insight or Workbench alert. You can use the data in the Trend Vision One app to further investigate Workbench insights and evaluate individual detections.

The following table outlines the actions available in the Observed Attack Techniques app:

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk level</strong>: The risk assigned to the detection filter as determined by Trend Micro threat experts</p>
<p>Trend Micro experts continuously assess threats and may update the risk level of a detection at any time based on the latest information available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detected</strong>: When the detection occurred</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data source / processor</strong>: The product that detected the event</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detection filter</strong>: Select from <strong>Detection filter</strong>, <strong>Tactic ID</strong>, or <strong>Technique ID</strong> to locate specific filter or MITRE data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also search by endpoint or container name in the search bar.</p></td>
