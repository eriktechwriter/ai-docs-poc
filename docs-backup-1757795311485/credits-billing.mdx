# Credits & Billing

Set up and manage your credit usage and billing models for paid Trend Vision One features, and estimate your overall credit requirements.

On the **Annual credits** tab, view detailed information about your valid credits, credit allocations, purchase history, and all available features that require credits.

On the **Pay-as-you-go** tab, view information about your pay-as-you-go contract and all features supporting pay-as-you-go.

On the **All available solutions** tab, view all Trend Vision One solutions available for purchase and estimate your credit requirements using the credit calculator.

:::tip

To switch supported Trend Vision One features between credit-based licensing and pay-as-you-go, click **Manage billing model**.

You must have a [pay-as-you-go contract](purchasing-payg-contract-aws.mdx) to manage features' billing models. If you have already purchased a contract, select a billing model for each supported feature in the **Manage billing model** window, then click **Continue** to review and confirm your changes.

You can change the billing model of each feature once every 30 days. Once you change the billing model of a feature, you must wait 30 days to change the billing model back.
