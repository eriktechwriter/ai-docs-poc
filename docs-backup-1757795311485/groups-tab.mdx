  <p>You create dynamic membership criteria to automatically add and remove devices. Dynamic group membership adds and removes group members automatically using membership criteria based on member attributes. When the attributes of a device change, the system evaluates all dynamic group criteria to see if the change would trigger any group adds or removes. If a device satisfies the criteria on a group, they are added as a member of that group. If they no longer satisfy the criteria, they are removed. You cannot manually add or remove a member of a dynamic group.</p></li>
