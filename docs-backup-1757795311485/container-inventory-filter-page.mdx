# Scan for malware and secrets in Artifact Scanner

June 27, 2024—Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) now supports artifact scanning for malware and secrets. This helps to identify and manage sensitive and confidential data that might have been inadvertently exposed, like passwords and API keys. You can also integrate TMAS secret scan results with Trend Vision One - Container Security runtime policies to prevent secrets from reaching production environments.

For more information, see [Artifact Scanner CLI](artifact-scanner-cli.mdx).
