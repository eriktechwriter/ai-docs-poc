# Communication triggers

:Communication triggers allows you to select criteria based on which [Checks](model-check.mdx) trigger automatic notifications to be sent via a [communication channel](communication-integrations.mdx) that has been set up. You can filter the Checks that trigger notifications using check/rule attributes and compliance standards. By default, the filter is set to 'All checks', meaning that you will be notified of all the failing Checks across all the *Categories* and *Risk Level*.

An alert consists of rule details including Account name, Risk Level, Region, Resource, Description, and Introduced by: "user name" (only for the RTPM Rules). The alerts also include ARN with an exception to Email and SMS communication channels.

:::note

For SNS and PagerDuty's channels ARN is displayed as providerResourceId.

For example, the alert generated below was sent to a user's Jira for the 'Rule S3 Configuration Changes':

:::note

We recommended that you set up notifications for *Extreme*, *Very High*, and *High*-Risk Levels so your channel is not cluttered by all checks and your teams get notified on priority risks.
