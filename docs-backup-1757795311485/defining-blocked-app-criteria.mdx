# Defining Blocked Application Criteria

Application Control provides the ability to define criteria that specifically block certain applications from executing. You can define block criteria to ensure that Application Control always blocks certain applications or you can create "Assessment" criteria to monitor the applications that users access.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Resources → Application Control Criteria**.

    The **Application Control Criteria** screen appears.

2.  Click **Add Criteria** and select **Block**.

    The **Block Criteria Settings** screen appears.

3.  Type a unique **Name** for the criteria.

4.  To create a monitoring rule, select **Enable assessment mode**.

    :::note

    Application Control logs all applications that match the assessment criteria but takes no further action. Application Control allows the applications to execute normally.
    :::

5.  Select the **Match method** used to identify applications and configure required settings.
