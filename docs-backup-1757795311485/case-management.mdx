# Case Management

Keep track of incident investigations, procedures, and supplemental information for threat alerts and risk events.

**Case Management** provides the following benefits:

- Streamlined event response through a single task management hub

- Collaboration using a platform-wide notebook tool that facilitates knowledge sharing and information exchange

- Insights into the tasks of the team managing a case, sources of risk, and distribution of responsibility in a centralized dashboard

- For [Managed XDR](managed-services.mdx) customers, direct communication from the Trend Micro MDR team to get incident alerts and recommended remediation actions.

The following table outlines the sections available in **Case Management** (**Workflow and Automation → Case Management**)
