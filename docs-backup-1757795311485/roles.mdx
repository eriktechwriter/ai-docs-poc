# Role

View information on the available roles in your organization along with assigned users to help better understand your organization's security posture.

The **Role** tab allows you to view the roles assigned to users, groups, or devices in your organization. Roles may be privileged or regular. Trend Micro recommends limiting active privileged roles in your organization to the fewest number of necessary roles.

:::warning[Important]

Only roles currently held by a user, group, or device are displayed.

The following table details the columns on the **Role** tab.
