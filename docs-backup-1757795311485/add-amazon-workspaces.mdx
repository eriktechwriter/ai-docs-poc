# Add Amazon WorkSpaces

::::warning[Important]

AWS Accounts in Trend Vision One are now managed by the Cloud Accounts app. To add new AWS accounts, see [Adding an AWS account using CloudFormation](adding-aws-account.mdx).

You can still use APIs to add new accounts to Server & Workload Protection. However, Trend Micro recommends using the Cloud Accounts app, which provides access to more advanced cloud security and XDR capabilities. This topic is for reference only.
:::

Amazon WorkSpaces are virtual cloud desktops that run in Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can protect them with Server & Workload Protection following the instructions below.

:::note

The agent only supports Amazon WorkSpaces Windows desktops â€” it does not support Linux desktops.

After completing the steps in one of the above-mentioned sections:

- your Amazon WorkSpaces are displayed in the Server & Workload Protection console on the left under *Computers* \> your_AWS_account \> your_region \> *WorkSpaces*.
- your Amazon WorkSpaces are protected by the agent.

## Protect Amazon WorkSpaces if you already added your AWS account {#protect-amazon-workspaces-if-you-already-added-your-aws-account}

If you already added your AWS account to Server & Workload Protection (to protect your Amazon EC2 instances), complete the steps in this section to configure Server & Workload Protection to work with Amazon WorkSpaces.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Launch an Amazon WorkSpace, and then install and activate agent version 10.2+ on it. See [Install the agent on Amazon EC2 and WorkSpaces](install-agent-amazon-ec2-workspaces.mdx) for details. Optionally, create a custom WorkSpace bundle so that you can deploy it to many people. See [Bake the agent into your AMI or WorkSpace bundle](install-agent-ami-workspace.mdx) for details on installation, activation, and bundle creation.

2.  Modify your IAM policy to include Amazon WorkSpaces permissions:

    1.  Log in to AWS with the account that was added to Server & Workload Protection.
    2.  Go to the *IAM* service.
    3.  Find the Server & Workload Protection IAM policy. You can find it under Policies on the left, or you can look for the Server & Workload Protection IAM role or IAM user that references the policy and then click the policy within it.
    4.  Modify the Server & Workload Protection IAM policy as shown below. The policy includes Amazon WorkSpaces permissions. If you added more than one AWS account to Server & Workload Protection, the IAM policy must be updated under all the AWS accounts.

    ```bash
            {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
            {
            "Sid": "cloudconnector",
            "Action": [
            "ec2:DescribeImages",
            "ec2:DescribeInstances",
            "ec2:DescribeRegions",
            "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
            "ec2:DescribeTags",
            "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
            "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
            "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
            "workspaces:DescribeWorkspaces",
            "workspaces:DescribeWorkspaceDirectories",
            "workspaces:DescribeWorkspaceBundles",
            "workspaces:DescribeTags",
            "iam:ListAccountAliases",
            "iam:GetRole",
            "iam:GetRolePolicy"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
            }
            ]
            }
    ```

3.  In the Server & Workload Protection console, edit your AWS account:

    1.  On the left, right-click your AWS account and select *Properties*.
    2.  Enable *Include Amazon WorkSpaces*.
    3.  Click *Save*.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

You have now added Amazon WorkSpaces to Server & Workload Protection.

## Protect Amazon WorkSpaces if you have not yet added your AWS account {#protect-amazon-workspaces-if-you-have-not-yet-added-your-aws-account}

If you have not yet added your AWS account to Server & Workload Protection, complete the steps in one of the following sections:

- If you want to protect existing Amazon WorkSpaces, read [Install the agent on Amazon EC2 and WorkSpaces.](install-agent-amazon-ec2-workspaces.mdx)
- If you want to be able to launch new Amazon WorkSpaces with the agent 'baked in', read [Bake the agent into your AMI or WorkSpace bundle](install-agent-ami-workspace.mdx).
