# Enable Amazon Macie

Amazon Macie is a data security service that integrates with Trend Vision One to scan S3 buckets for sensitive data and potential data leak issues. You can use Amazon Macie in addition to enabling Data Security Posture for your AWS accounts.

To use Data Security Posture with Amazon Macie, you must enable the **Automated Discovery** setting in Amazon Macie on your AWS account. **Automated Discovery** is enabled by default when you enable Amazon Macie, so if you've already set up Amazon Macie on your AWS account, you only need to verify that it has not been disabled.
