# Risk factors

:View your organization's overall Cyber Risk Index along with the contributing risk factors.

The **Risk Factors** tab displays the overall [Cyber Risk Index](risk-index-overview.mdx) for your organization over the last 30 days. For an overview of the total points currently contributed by risk events within each risk factor, hover over the corresponding section of the radar chart. To view detailed information about the assets included in the risk analysis, click [View Assessment Profiles](asset-profile-screens.mdx).

Hover over the trend graph to see the overall Cyber Risk Index plus point increases and decreases for the corresponding day. For more detailed information on daily Cyber Risk Index changes, click **View daily risk events**.

**Daily Risk Events** displays the following information about changes in the Cyber Risk Index to help you understand and prioritize risk remediation efforts:

- The point change compared to the previous day

- The point change contributed by each risk factor on the specified day

- A list of contributing risk events from each risk factor

- An event timeline detailing instances of specific risk events, the status of the instances, and impacted assets

:::note

- Risk event instances older than 30 days on the specified day are included in the **Expired event instances** count. Expired risk events contribute to reductions in the Cyber Risk Index.

- Points contributed by individual risk event types, including previously detected event types that have no new or remediated instances, may vary day to day due to changes in how risk events are weighted in the Cyber Risk Index calculation.

  .
:::

In **Risk Factors**, high-risk events, vulnerabilities, or alerts that contribute to the Cyber Risk Index are organized by individual risk factor. Select any risk factor to view related information and widgets. When no risk factor is selected, [Risk Reduction Measures](risk-reduction-measures.mdx) displays your [currently selected risk reduction goal](selecting-risk-reduction-goal.mdx) and the risk events that should be addressed to meet the goal.

:::note

The risk event count for each risk factor and the Cyber Risk Index trend graph are only visible for users with full asset visibility scope.
