# Granting access to Microsoft teams

Grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Microsoft Teams (Teams) to allow Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to run advanced threat protection and data loss prevention scanning on files in protected teams.

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection protects the Teams and Chat services in Microsoft Teams separately.

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection scans files that employees share in team channels, which are stored in SharePoint.

If you have also granted Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to SharePoint Online, when the SharePoint site and the team corresponding to a file are selected as a policy target respectively, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection applies policies for Microsoft Teams (Teams) to this site unless the site does not hit any policy for Microsoft Teams.
