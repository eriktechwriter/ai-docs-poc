# Google Cloud projects

Manage connections with your Google Cloud projects to allow Trend Vision One visibility into your cloud environment.

:::note

Google Cloud is used in this document to refer to services formerly known as Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
:::

The Google Cloud screen allows you to view connected Google Cloud projects and manage connections within the Cloud Accounts app. You can access the Google Cloud screen on the Trend Vision One console by navigating to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → Google Cloud** and clicking on the **Google Cloud** tab.

You can take the following actions from the Google Cloud screen.
