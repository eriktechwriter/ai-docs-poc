# Enhanced Correlated Intelligence monitoring for existing ATP policies in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection

October 25, 2024—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection enhances the monitoring of Correlated Intelligence detections without disrupting your email flow. This update automatically enables the Correlated Intelligence filter for policies where this filter is currently disabled, allowing you to keep track of Correlated Intelligence detections seamlessly while maintaining smooth email operations. Specifically,

- For existing policies without Correlated Intelligence enabled, the action for Security Risks is set to **Pass**, and “All pre-defined rules” is selected for anomalies with the action set to **Pass**.

- For existing policies with Correlated Intelligence enabled, no changes are made to the action for Security Risks. However, if “Specified pre-defined rules” was selected for anomalies with no rules specified, it is changed to “All pre-defined rules” with the action set to **Pass**.
