# Moving Trend Cloud One Agents Quick Guide

Move agents to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security using a deployment script.

The following steps detail how to move agents from Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security to the new Trend Vision One Endpoint Security for evaluation of Server & Workload Protection.

Before starting, you must deactivate the target agent you want to move.

- For information on how to deactivate agents, see [Deactivate the agent](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security-agent-activate) on the Trend Cloud One Help Center.

- You may also need to disable agent self-protection before you can deactivate the agent. For more information, see [Enable or disable agent self-protection](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security-agent-self-protection) on the Trend Cloud One Help Center.
