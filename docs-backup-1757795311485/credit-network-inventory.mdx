# Credit allocation for Network Security

::Learn how to calculate your credit requirements based on your Network Inventory configuration.

The credit requirements for Network Security features are based on the bandwidth usage of your configured Network Sensors.

:::note

Network Inventory retains data for all Network Sensors for 180 days.

Your total **Network Sensor bandwidth** is displayed at the top of the Network Inventory app screen. Click **Bandwidth usage** to view a breakdown of bandwidth usage by sensor type and individual connected sensors. You can view the current credit requirements by hovering your mouse over **Credit Usage** or clicking the **Credit Settings** icon (![](/images/gear_icon=fc9a51ad-35af-4fe3-92c6-5e41b2dfc5d9.webp)).

For Virtual Network Sensors, average throughput is calculated on each Virtual Network Sensor up to the last 30 days. The averages are added together and rounded up to the nearest 500 Mbps to determine bandwidth usage and calculate the credit requirement. Newly deployed Virtual Network Sensors can only calculate their usage up to when the sensor was first connected to Network Inventory.

:::tip

You can view your actual scanned bandwidth with the Monitored Network Throughput widget in the [Dashboards](security-dashboard.mdx) app.
:::

The first time you choose to deploy a Virtual Network Sensor, you are given a 30-day free trial. During the trial, Network Inventory starts calculating your average scanned throughput. If you choose to auto-allocate credits at the end of your trial, the required credits are calculated based on your average usage during the trial period.

You can use the Send to sandbox for Virtual Network Sensor feature during the 30-day free trial without allocating credits.

:::warning[Important]

If you do not turn on credit auto-allocation during the free trial, your Virtual Network Sensors are disconnected at the end of the trial. To reconnect, you must turn on dynamic allocation of credits.
