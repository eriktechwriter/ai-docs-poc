# Adding a Google Cloud organization or folder

Add and connect multiple Google Cloud projects at once by adding Google Cloud organizations or folders to the Cloud Accounts app. Trend Vision One provides security for all Google Cloud projects and assets within the organization or folder.

Adding a Google Cloud organization or folder to the Cloud Accounts app allows Trend Vision One to access your cloud service to provide security and visibility into your cloud assets.

This feature offers flexibility by allowing you to:

- add a Google Cloud organization, which adds all projects within the organization to Cloud Accounts

- add a Google Cloud folder, which adds all projects within the folder to Cloud Accounts

- provide a list of the Google Cloud projects that you do not want added to Trend Vision One.

Before you begin, review the [permission requirements](gcp-required-permissions.mdx) for connecting a Google Cloud project to Cloud Accounts. To add a Google Cloud organization or folder to Cloud Accounts, you must sign in with a user or identity that has the **Owner** and **Organization Administrator** roles.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Sign in to the Trend Vision One console.

2.  In a new tab in the same browser session, sign in to the Google Cloud organization or folder you want to connect and access the Cloud Shell.

3.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → Google Cloud**.

4.  Click **Google Cloud Organization** and then click **Next**.

    The **Add Google Cloud Project** screen appears.

5.  Specify the **Organization ID** or **Folder ID**.

6.  Specify a **Description** to help identify the organization or folder.

7.  Specify the projects that you want to exclude from being added to Trend Vision One.

    Make a list of current projects in your Organization or Folder that you don't want included. You can also make a list of project names to automatically exclude in the future if they are ever added.

8.  Select the region to deploy the terraform script.

9.  Click **Next**.

    The next screen opens to display the features and permissions for the Google Cloud organization or folder. By default, **Core Features and Cyber Risk Exposure Management** is enabled and cannot be disabled.

10. If you are unsure whether Cyber Risk Exposure Management is enabled in Trend Vision One, complete the following steps: :

    1.  Click to expand **Core Features and Cyber Risk Exposure Management**. If Cyber Risk Exposure Management is disabled, then continue these steps to enable it. If it is enabled, go to step 11.

    2.  Click **Capabilities** to open the **Cloud Account Settings** drawer.

    3.  Select the checkbox beside **Cyber Risk Exposure Management**.

        :::note

        :::

    4.  Click **Save Changes**.

11. Click **Next**.

12. In Google Cloud Shell, access the command line interface.

    :::note

    The Add Google Cloud Project screen in the Trend Vision One console provides a set of commands to help complete the following steps. To complete the connection process, you must copy each command provided in the screen to enable the **Done** button.
    :::

13. Create a new directory for the deployment folder within the organization or folder you want to connect.

    Copy the command from the Add Google Cloud Project screen.

14. Choose your upload method.

    - To use a command to upload the template directly to your CloudShell, select **Upload via CLI**.

      Copy and paste the `curl` command into your CloudShell interface to retrieve the template package. The command is dynamically generated based on your account and region.

    - To download the template first and upload from your local machine, select **Manual Upload**.

      Click **Download the Terraform Template** to save the template to your local machine. Make sure your CloudShell environment is set to the same region you selected for the terraform deployment before uploading the package.

15. Extract the template using the command in the Add Google Cloud Project screen.

    The .zip file name contains a randomly generated number. Copy the command to extract the file.

16. Navigate to the deployment folder by copying the command in the Add Google Cloud Project screen.

    :::warning[Important]

    The resource creation script must be the only terraform file in the directory. Having more than one terraform file in the folder interferes with deployment process and might cause the connection to fail.
    :::

17. Initiate Terraform and run the deployment script.

    Google Cloud Shell begins the terraform process to deploy Trend Vision One security resources.

18. In the Trend Vision One console, in the Add Google Cloud Project screen, click **Done**.

    :::note

    If the **Done** button is not enabled, make sure you have copied the command line for each step on the screen.
    :::

    The connection process might take a few moments to complete. You can refresh the Cloud Accounts screen to check the status of the projects in your added organization.
