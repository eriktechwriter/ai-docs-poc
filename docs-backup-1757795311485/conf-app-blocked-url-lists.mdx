# Configuring the Approved and Blocked URL Lists

Add websites that you consider safe or dangerous to the approved or blocked list. When Apex One (Mac) detects access to any of these websites, it automatically allows or blocks the access and no longer sends a query to smart protection sources.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Access the Apex One (Mac) web console.

2.  Navigate to **Agents → Global Agent Settings → Web Reputation Approved/Blocked URL List**.

3.  Specify a URL in the text box. You can add a wildcard character (\*) anywhere on the URL.

    Examples:

    - `www.trendmicro.com/*` means all pages on the www.trendmicro.com domain.

    - `*.trendmicro.com/*` means all pages on any sub-domain of trendmicro.com.

    You can type URLs containing IP addresses. If a URL contains an IPv6 address, enclose the address in square brackets.

4.  Click **Add to Approved List** or **Add to Blocked List**.

5.  To delete an entry, select an option from the **View** drop-down list and click the icon next to a URL.

6.  Click **Deploy**.
