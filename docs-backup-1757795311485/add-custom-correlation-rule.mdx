# Adding a custom correlation rule

Add custom correlation rules to accommodate detection requirements in your environment.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Correlation Rules** tab, click **Add Rule**.

2.  Specify a name for the rule and optionally provide a description in the **Basic Properties** area. The name can help clearly identify what anomaly you want to detect.

3.  Define one or multiple statements that comprise the rule.

    A statement combines detection signals and the AND operator.

    1.  Select a detection signal type from the drop-down list to filter out the available signals, and then select a desired signal from the next drop-down list.

    2.  If you need one more signals to comprise the statement, click **Add Signal**.

    3.  Repeat the previous step to add more signals to the statement.

        Click the ![](/images/recipient_group_delete=GUID-42C3CD61-5E70-4549-9B92-59F3D2E47E6C=en-us=.webp) icon to remove a signal if it is not needed.

    4.  When the statement definition is completed, click **Add Statement to Rule**.

4.  Define more statements as needed and add them to the **Rule Definition** area by repeating Step 3.

5.  View and confirm that the rule definition meets your requirement.

    A rule combines statements and the OR operator to tag and detect the required anomalies in your environment. The rule is matched when any of its statements is met.

6.  Click **Save**.
