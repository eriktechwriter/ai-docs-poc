# Adding an internal application to Private Access

Add your organization's private application to the internal apps list, and associate it with a Private Access Connector group in the same environment.

:::warning[Important]

Zero Trust Secure Access does not support overlapping IP addresses when configuring Internal Applications. Internal applications should be individually segmented networks; different internal applications should not have overlapping IP ranges.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Internal Applications** tab, click **Add Internal Application**.

    The **Add Internal Application** screen appears.

2.  Specify a unique application name and description.

3.  Select **Use the default icon** or **Upload an image** .

    :::note

    The app name, icon, and description appear in the accessible corporate applications list on the Secure Access Module deployed to endpoints (for client access), and on the Trend Micro provided user portal (for browser access).
    :::

4.  Select an existing Private Access Connector group, or [create a new group](private-access-connector-config.mdx).

    Ensure that the connector group is deployed in the same corporate environment as the app, and the app is accessible from any connector under the group.

5.  Specify a tag name for this app, or select a Trend Micro predefined or a user-defined tag from the drop-down list.

    App group tags allow you to identify a group of internal apps and easily apply secure access rules to the apps within the same group.

6.  Configure user access through the Secure Access Module.

    1.  Click the **Client Access** tab.

    2.  Select **Allow users to access via the Secure Access Module**.

    3.  Select the required protocol.

    4.  For HTTP or HTTPS protocols, automatically direct users to the app's home page by specifying a home page URL and then click **Parse**. The app's FQDN or IP address is automatically added in the URL fields below.

    5.  Specify at least one FQDN or IP address of the application, and any required ports to connect to the application.

        :::warning[Important]

        Zero Trust Secure Access does not support overlapping IP addresses. You must ensure that address is not being used in another internal app.
        :::

    6.  If you have selected an unencrypted protocol for app access, choose whether to allow Private Access to encrypt traffic sent between the endpoint and the Private Access Connector.

        Supported protocols for endpoint-to-connector traffic encryption include:

        - TCP/UDP

        - DNS

        - HTTP

        - FTP

        - SMB

        - TELNET

        - VNC

        :::warning[Important]

        Encrypting app traffic transmitted using an unencrypted protocol consumes a high amount of system resources and will impact performance when connecting to internal apps. Enabling the feature is recommended only for the transfer of sensitive data.
        :::

    :::note

    Zero Trust Secure Access does not support suffixes for client access of apps using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
    :::

    :::tip

    Some HTTP/HTTPS web apps require that you configure access to other internal apps to function. To find associated apps, install the [Trend Micro Web App Discovery Chrome extension](web-app-discovery-chrome.mdx).
    :::

7.  Configure user access through the web browser user portal.

    1.  Click the **Browser Access** tab.

    2.  Select **Allow users to request access via a user portal provided by Trend Micro**.

    3.  Select the required communication protocol.

        - **HTTP**

          1.  **Internal URL**: Specify the FQDN or IP address and the required port that the internal network uses to connect to the internal application.

          2.  **External URL**: Specify the FQDN or IP address and the required port for the external domain that end users access to connect to the internal application.

          3.  **Canonical name (CNAME)**: Click **here** to create a canonical name.

        - **HTTPS**: Specify the FQDN or IP address, and the required port to connect to the internal application.

          1.  **Internal URL**: Specify the FQDN or IP address and the required port that the internal network uses to connect to the internal application.

          2.  **External URL**: Specify the FQDN or IP address and the required port for the external domain that end users access to connect to the internal application.

          3.  **Canonical name (CNAME)**: Click **here** to create a canonical name.

          4.  **Certificate**: Select a **Default certificate**, or **Add a server certificate**.

        - **Web-based RDP**: Specify the FQDN or IP address, and the required port of the remote desktop to connect to the internal application.

          Zero Trust Private Access - Browser Access supports selecting a keyboard layout when accessing Web-RDP internal applications. You can choose your preferred keyboard layout when accessing your internal applications in your browser through the User Portal.

          Ensure that the remote server is configured to use the same keyboard layout for accurate input during access.

          Browser Access supports the following keyboard layouts:

          - Czech (Czech Republic)

          - Danish (Denmark)

          - German (Switzerland)

          - German (Germany)

          - English (United Kingdom)

          - English (United States)

          - Spanish (Spain)

          - Spanish (Latin America)

          - French (Belgium)

          - French (Canada)

          - French (Switzerland)

          - French (France)

          - Hungarian (Hungary)

          - Italian (Italy)

          - Japanese (Japan)

          - Norwegian (Norway)

          - Polish (Poland)

          - Portuguese (Brazil)

          - Portuguese (Portugal)

          - Romanian (Romania)

          - Swedish (Sweden)

          - Turkish (Turkey)

        - **Web-based SSH**: Specify the FQDN or IP address, and the required port of the remote server to connect to the internal application.

    :::note

    Zero Trust Secure Access does not support overlapping IPv4 IP addresses when configuring Internal Applications for either Browser Access or Client Access. Each Internal Application should be individually segmented, and different internal apps should not have an overlapping IPv4 IP address range.
