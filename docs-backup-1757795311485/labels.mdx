# Labels

Labels are a variation of the existing tagging system that also provide filtering capability. You can create labels and manually assign labels to endpoints just as if you were using tags/filters. You can also create auto-label rules to automatically assign labels to endpoints that match specified criteria. After you have created a label or auto-label rule, you can use labels for policies, log queries, or reports.
