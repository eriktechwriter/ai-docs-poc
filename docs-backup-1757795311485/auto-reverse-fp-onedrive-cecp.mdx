# Automatic reversal of false positive quarantines in OneDrive

July 18, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection leverages the latest URL pattern intelligence to automatically identify false positive URLs in files within OneDrive, as detected by Web Reputation Services. When a false positive is confirmed, the system retrieves the relevant file information from the detection logs and automatically reverses the Quarantine action, restoring the file to its original location in the corresponding collaboration service.
