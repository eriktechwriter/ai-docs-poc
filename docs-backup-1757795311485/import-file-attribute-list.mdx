# Importing a file attribute list

Use this option if you have a properly-formatted `.xml` file containing the file attribute lists. You can generate the file by exporting the file attribute lists from the Cloud Email Gateway Protection administrator console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration → Policy Objects → DLP Data Identifiers**.

2.  Click the **File Attribute** tab.

3.  Click **Import** and then locate the `.xml` file containing the file attribute lists.

4.  Click **Open**.

    A message appears, informing you if the import was successful.

    :::note

    Every file attribute list is identified by its *name* field in the `.xml` file. This name is a unique internal name that does not display on the administrator console.

    If the file contains a customized file attribute list that already exists, Cloud Email Gateway Protection overwrites the existing file attribute list. If the file contains any predefined file attribute list, Cloud Email Gateway Protection skips the predefined file attribute list while importing the remaining customized file attribute lists.
