# File profiles

Manage the file profiles that you can use in secure access rules to allow or deny access to certain types of content on the internet.

A file profile identifies the types of files that are allowed or blocked to access for security, monitoring, or performance purposes. You can specify files by media type, file name, or true file type, and group them as a file profile. With file profiles, you can define and enforce internet access rules so that users can visit only specific types of content on the internet.

:::note

File profiles can be applied to the following:

- Internet access rules

- Threat protection profiles

The following table outlines the actions available on the **File Profiles** tab (**Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Resources → File Profiles**).
