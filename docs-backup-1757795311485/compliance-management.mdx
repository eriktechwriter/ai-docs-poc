# Compliance Management

Trend Vision One Compliance Management offers a centralized compliance overview for the platform, endpoint, and email security layers in your environment.

:::note

- Compliance Management identifies gaps and measures progress towards compliance with a framework or standard, but does not provide certification or guarantee compliance.

- The security layers and remediation actions mapped to each control do not necessarily represent that of the standard or framework authority, and are not equivalent to the related security controls.
:::

Use **Compliance Management** (**Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Compliance Management**) to identify configuration gaps in your organization and measure progress towards compliance with a specific framework or standard. Compliance Management provides a centralized overview of your connected data sources and the pass rate of your organization’s configurations for each security layer.

The **pass rate** (percentage) is calculated as the total number of passes out of all checks made by Compliance Management on your resources included in the filtered criteria. A **pass** is defined as a Trend Micro feature or a setting being enabled and configured according to the controls of a selected framework or standard. A **fail** is defined as a Trend Micro feature that is not enabled or a setting that is not enabled and configured according to the controls of a selected framework or standard.

The displayed pass and fail percentages are dependent on your selected filters, the data access you have provided on your resources (or have been provided by your organization administrator), and the controls which Compliance Management is able to check for on resources (which does not include organizational processes and other exclusions).

The following table lists the options available in **Compliance Management**.
