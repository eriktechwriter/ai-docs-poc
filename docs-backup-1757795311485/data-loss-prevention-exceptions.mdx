# Data Loss Prevention Exceptions

DLP exceptions apply to the entire policy, including all rules defined within the policy. Data Loss Prevention applies the exception settings to all transmissions before scanning for digital assets. If a transmission matches one of the exception rules, Data Loss Prevention immediately allows or scans the transmission depending on the exception type.
