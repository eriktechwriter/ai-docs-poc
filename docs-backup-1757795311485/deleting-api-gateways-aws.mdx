# Delete API gateways in AWS

You can delete an AWS API gateway or endpoint in the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.

:::note

Before deleting an API gateway or endpoint, consider the following:

- **Check dependencies**: Ensure that no resources depend on the API Gateway you plan to delete.
- **Backup configuration**: Before deleting, consider exporting the API configuration in case you need it later.
- **Permissions**: You need appropriate permissions to delete API gateways.
- **Irreversible**: Deletion is irreversible. After you delete an API gateway, you cannot recover it.
