# Public cloud app activity

View information about the **Public cloud app activity** risk factor, which is determined by user and endpoint access to suspicious public cloud applications.

**Threat and Exposure Management** assesses user accounts and endpoints for any public cloud app activity to detect potentially risky public cloud apps. If the assessment of public cloud app access indicates a risk, the public cloud app access information displays in the **Top 5 High Risk Public Cloud Apps with the Most Visits** and the **High Risk Public Cloud App Visits** widgets. The Cloud App Activity risk factor contributes to your [exposure level](exposure-overview.mdx).

When viewing risk events, click the number in the case column to view current cases involving the specified risk event. Click the options icon (![](/images/options=ddb0b67f-0654-4aa5-8bc7-48ec554c5448.webp)) to open a new case for the risk event or add the case to an existing risk event.
