# Approved and blocked lists

Manage the approved and blocked lists centrally, applying them consistently across all supported Email and Collaboration Security solutions.

The approved and blocked lists in Email and Collaboration Security provide a centralized way to manage trusted and suspicious objects across your organization’s email and collaboration environments. These lists are designed to streamline policy enforcement and improve detection accuracy across supported solutions, including Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection and Cloud Email Gateway Protection.

The blocked list allows administrators to define specific senders, domains, or other indicators that should be proactively blocked. When configured, these entries act as a pre-policy filter, preventing emails or collaboration content containing known threats or unwanted sources from being delivered or accessed. This early-stage filtering helps reduce the risk of exposure to malicious content and minimizes the burden on downstream security layers. Blocked list entries are managed through [Suspicious Object Management](suspicious-object-list.mdx), where you can view, add, or remove entries.

The approved list, on the other hand, is used to allow trusted senders or content to bypass certain filtering steps. This helps reduce false positives and ensures smoother delivery and access for known-good sources across both email and collaboration platforms.

:::note

Only sender address is currently supported for the approved list.

By managing these lists centrally, administrators benefit from a “configure once, apply everywhere” model. This not only reduces configuration effort and administrative overhead, but also ensures consistent enforcement of security policies across the entire organization. It enhances your overall user experience and reinforces Email and Collaboration Security on Trend Vision One as a unified, integrated security solution.

Approved and blocked objects apply across all supported Email and Collaboration Security solutions when configured centrally. If you prefer to apply an approved or blocked object to a specific solution only, you can configure it directly within that solution. For example, for Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, in the [Advanced Threat Protection](adding-atp-policies.mdx) or [Data Loss Prevention](adding-dlp-policies.mdx) policies or in the [approved/blocked lists](configuring-approved-blocked-lists.mdx) under **Global settings**.

Please note that additional configuration may be required within individual solutions to ensure approved or blocked objects function as expected. For example, for Cloud Email Gateway Protection, to specify whether to skip certain security checks on emails from approved senders, go to the [sender filter](managing-sender-filter.mdx) settings under **Inbound Protection**. Always refer to the relevant solution’s documentation to complete any necessary setup.
