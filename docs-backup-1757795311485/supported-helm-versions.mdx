# Supported Helm versions

::Container Security components use the Helm package manager for Kubernetes. To ensure continued rule updates, Trend Micro recommends using the latest version of Helm chart available. See Upgrade Helm chart.

:::note

- Clusters that run Helm chart versions 3.0.1 and later can support both x86 and ARM platforms for runtime malware scanning.
- Clusters that run Helm chart versions older than 2.3.25 (or 1.0.8 for ECS) will no longer receive new rule updates.
- Clusters that run Helm chart versions 2.6.7 and later can support all proxy settings for runtime malware scanning.
- Clusters that use unsupported Helm chart versions retain protection from their last downloaded rules file but might have error logs in Scout for rule download failures.

### Install Helm chart {#install-helm-chart}

Starting with version 3.0.0, Helm chart will be in a new location, <https://github.com/trendmicro/visionone-container-security-helm>. Only this new version of Helm chart will receive updates.

1.  Create a file named `overrides.yaml`, which is used to contain your cluster-specific settings.

    :::note

    You can find the setting values in the Trend Vision One console or the Container Security API when you create a cluster. See the [Values.yaml](https://github.com/trendmicro/cloudone-container-security-helm/blob/master/values.yaml) file for a reference when creating your overrides file.
    :::

2.  Use `helm` to install Container Security components with your cluster-specific settings. We recommend that you run Container Security in its own namespace.

3.  To install Helm chart into an existing Kubernetes namespace, use the `--namespace` flag with the `helm install` command:

    ```bash
    helm install \
        --values overrides.yaml \
        --namespace ${namespace} \
        trendmicro \
        https://github.com/trendmicro/visionone-container-security-helm/archive/main.tar.gz
    ```

:::note

For more information about `helm install`, see the [Helm installation documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/).

The table below describes environments that require specific settings.

<td><p>If you are using Container Security in a pure AWS EKS Fargate environment, you might need to adjust your Fargate profile to allow pods in a non-default namespace (ex: <code>trendmicro-system</code>). See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile">AWS documentation</a> for more information on Fargate profiles.</p></td>

<td>Red Hat OpenShift</td>
<td><p>If you are using Container Security in a <strong>Red Hat OpenShift</strong> environment, the Helm Chart creates a <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints">Security Context Constraint</a> to allow Container Security components to have the minimum security context requirements to run.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pod Security Admission</td>
<td><p>If you are using Container Security in a cluster with Pod Security Admission and you have runtime security enabled, ensure the namespace where Container Security is installed is using the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/">privileged Pod Security Standards policy</a>.</p></td>

### Upgrade Helm chart {#upgrade-helm-chart}

Use the following to upgrade an existing installation in the default Kubernetes namespace to the latest version:

:::note

Helm overrides the reset values in `overrides.yaml` when upgraded.
:::

```bash
helm upgrade \
    --values overrides.yaml \
    --namespace ${namespace} \
    trendmicro \
    https://github.com/trendmicro/visionone-container-security-helm/archive/main.tar.gz
```

To use the previously set values, use the `--reuse-values` option during a Helm upgrade:

```bash
helm upgrade \
    --namespace ${namespace} \
    --reuse-values \
    trendmicro \
    https://github.com/trendmicro/visionone-container-security-helm/archive/main.tar.gz
```
