Add mobile apps to manage from Apple's App Store and configure settings for the apps.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Mobile Security → Managed Mobile Apps**.

2.  Add an app from Apple's App Store.

    1.  Choose **Add → iOS/iPadOS store app**.

    2.  On the **Select an app from Apple's App Store** screen, type the name of an app to search for the app.

    3.  In the search result, click **Select** next to the app.

        The **App Details** screen appears, displaying basic information about the app.

3.  Assign the app to groups and specify app settings for the selected groups.

    1.  In the **Assignments** section, click **Add Assignment**.

    2.  Select assignment groups to assign the app to and click **Next**.

    3.  Select an install type for the app.

        - **Prompt to install**: Users will be prompted to install the app on devices.

        - **Force remove**: The app will be automatically removed from the devices.

          :::note

          The option removes an app only when it was pushed by Mobile Security. It does not remove a manually installed app.

    4.  If you select **Prompt to install**, configure app settings to control data backup and app removal.

        - When the device is enrolled:

          - **Prevent app data backup to iCloud**: The app will not backup data to iCloud.

          - **Prevent app removal**: The app cannot be removed from the device.

        - When the device is unenrolled:

          - **Remove app automatically**: The app is automatically removed from the device.

    5.  In the text box under the **App configuration** section, specify app configuration in XML format to customize the app functions and behavior.

        Click **example format** to view an example for the XML data.

        The key values support wildcards. Hover over **wildcard** to check the list of supported wildcards.

    6.  Click **Save**.

        The assignment appears in the **Assignments** section. **Mobile Security** starts pushing the app to target devices.

        To update the app assignment and related settings later, click the assignment group in the **Assignments** section to make the changes.
