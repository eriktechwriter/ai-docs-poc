# Data Posture Security now available for Azure subscriptions

July 17, 2025 — Data Security Posture is now extended to Azure subscriptions. With this feature, you can now comprehensively monitor sensitive data and prevent data leakage caused by misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your Azure environments. This update offers you the same level of data protection and risk mitigation in Azure that was previously exclusive to AWS environments. For more information, see [Enable Data Security Posture on an Azure subscription](data-security-posture-azure.mdx).
