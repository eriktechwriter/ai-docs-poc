# Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access and Internet Access now supports custom service status on individual endpoints

January 29, 2024—Zero Trust Secure Access now allows users to set the service status for Internet Access and Private Access on single endpoints. Users may choose to align the service status for the endpoint with the current global configuration or choose to never enable either service on selected endpoints. Configure endpoints from the endpoint list on the Secure Access Module screen.
