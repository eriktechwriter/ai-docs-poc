# Ensure computers that are offline for extended periods of time remain protected with Server & Workload Protection

Inactive agent cleanup might remove protected computers that communicate irregularly with Server & Workload Protection if they do not communicate within the specified period of inactivity. Follow the steps below to allow your protected computers to reconnect to Server & Workload Protection.

:::warning[Important]

When reconnecting, a removed computer does not have an assigned policy and is added as a new computer. Server & Workload Protection removes any direct links to the computer from event data.

You can automatically assign a policy assigned to a computer upon agent-initiated activation with an [event-based task](autotasks-computer-changed-event.mdx).
