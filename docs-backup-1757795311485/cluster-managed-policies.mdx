# Cluster-managed policies

With cluster-managed policies, you can define the Container Security policies and runtime rulesets as custom resources in a yaml file. These custom resources can be managed with version control and deployed to the cluster with the CI/CD or GitOps workflow with other Kubernetes manifest files.

Cluster-managed policies are defined in their source code as Container Security policy and ruleset custom resources and are read-only to users in the Trend Vision One console after being created.

:::note

**Allow policy drift** enables you to modify the policy rules for your cluster-managed policies, which could potentially lead to policy inconsistencies. This option can only be enabled in the Trend Vision One console and should primarily be used in situations when an immediate policy adjustment is required. Enable **Allow policy drift** in **Cloud Security → Container Security → Container Inventory → Kubernetes → \[cluster name\]**.
:::

To use cluster-managed policies, create the cluster policy and runtime ruleset custom resources in your cluster. To disable cluster-managed policies, delete the cluster policy and runtime ruleset custom resources. Only the helm chart policy operator can create or disable cluster-managed policies, which simplifies policy management and ruleset assignment. For more information, see [Enabling cluster-managed policies](enabling-cluster-managed-policies.mdx).
