# Enroll endpoint groups in Endpoint Security Policies

Allow Endpoint Security Policies to manage the Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection features of your Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents.

:::warning[Important]

- If this is your first time using the new Endpoint Security Policies, please read [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx). This version of Endpoint Security Policies is an updated and improved version which integrates most features from Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection. However, support for some features is still under development. Review [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx) to avoid any potential interruption to your security environment.
:::

Enrolling your endpoint groups allows Endpoint Security Policies to centrally manage your Protection Manager settings for the assigned groups.

To enroll your endpoint groups, go to **Endpoint Security Configuration → Endpoint Security Policies → Assignments** and toggle the enrollment on.
