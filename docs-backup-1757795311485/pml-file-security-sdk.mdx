# Predictive Machine Learning in File Security

Trend Micro Predictive Machine Learning (PML) uses advanced machine learning technology to correlate threat information and perform in-depth file analysis to detect emerging unknown security risks through digital fingerprinting, application programming interface (API) mapping, and other file features.

In File Security, when PML detects an unknown or low-prevalence file, the Advanced Threat Scan Engine (ATSE) extracts the file's metadata and sends the report to the PML engine hosted on the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network (SPN). Through use of malware modeling, PML compares the sample to the malware model, assigns a probability score, and determines the probable malware type that the file contains.

Current, File Security supports Predictive Machine Learning in:

- File Security SDK
- File Security Virtual Appliance
