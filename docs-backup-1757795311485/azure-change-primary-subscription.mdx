# Azure script to change the primary subscription

When adding an Azure management group to Cloud Accounts, you can specify which Azure subscription that you want to set as the primary subscription. By default, Trend Vision One selects the first subscription in the management group as the primary subscription, and registers Cloud Accounts with that subscription. If you want to select a different subscription, you can specify which subscription to use when initiating Terraform deployment in Trend Vision One.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Copy the following command:` ./mgmt_group_deploy.sh --primary-subscription <subscription_id > `where `<subscription_id >` is the ID of the subscription you want to set as the primary subscription.

2.  Use this command instead of the one provided in the Trend Vision One console when initiating TerraForm deployment. For more information, see [Adding an Azure Management Group](adding-azure-management-group.mdx).
