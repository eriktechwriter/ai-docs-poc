# Connecting a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance using Service Gateway as a proxy

Connect a Deep Discover Inspector appliance using a Service Gateway as a proxy.

Connecting your Deep Discovery Inspector appliance to **Network Security** using a Service Gateway as a proxy automatically configures the appliance connection settings, including using the Service Gateway as a service source.

Before connecting to **Network Security** using a Service Gateway as a proxy, make sure you have configured a Service Gateway with the following services enabled. For more information, see [Manage services in Service Gateway](managing-services-service-gateway.mdx).

- Forward Proxy Service

- ActiveUpdate

- Smart Protection Services

- Suspicious Object List synchronization (only required for Deep Discovery Inspector version 6.7)

:::warning[Important]

- Connecting to **Network Security** using a Service Gateway as a proxy is only supported by Deep Discovery Inspector version 6.7 or later.

- If you are connecting a Deep Discovery Inspector virtual appliance deployed using an image that is not company-specific, you must [activate the license](activate-ddi-clp.mdx) before connecting to **Network Security**.
