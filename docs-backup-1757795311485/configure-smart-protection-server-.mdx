### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to *Policies*.

    1.  Select *Connect directly to Global Smart Protection Service*.

    1.  Select *Use locally installed Smart Protection Server (ex: "http://\[server\]:5274")*.

    2.  Enter the Smart Protection Server URL into the field and click *Add*. To find the Smart Protection Server URL, do one of the following:

        - Log in to the Smart Protection Server, and in the main pane, look under *Real Time Status*. The Smart Protection Server's HTTP and HTTPS URLs are listed in the *Web Reputation* row. The HTTPS URL is only supported with agent versions 11.0 and newer. If you have 10.3 or earlier agents, use the HTTP URL.

        Or

        - If you [deployed the Smart Protection Server in AWS](integrate-smart-protection-server.mdx), go to the AWS CloudFormation service, select the check box next to the Smart Protection Server stack, and in the bottom pane, click the *Outputs* tab. The Smart Protection Server's HTTP and HTTPS URLs appear in the *WRSurl* and *WRSHTTPSurl* fields. The WRSHTTPSurl is only supported with agent versions 11.0 and newer. If you have 10.3 or earlier agents, use the WRSurl URL.

    3.  Optionally select *When off domain, connect to global Smart Protection Service. (Windows only)*.

5.  Configure the **Smart Protection Server Connection Warning**.

    This option determines whether error events are generated and alerts are raised if a computer loses its connection to the Smart Protection Server. Select either *Yes* or *No* and click *Save*.

    :::note

    If you have a locally installed Smart Protection Server, this option should be set to Yes on at least one computer so that you are notified if there is a problem with the Smart Protection Server itself.
