# Creating a Template

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Templates**.

2.  Click **Add**.

    A new screen displays.

3.  Type a name for the template. The name must not exceed 100 bytes in length and cannot contain the following characters:

    - \> \< \* ^ | & ? \\ /

4.  Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.

5.  Select data identifiers and then click the "add" icon.

    When selecting definitions:

    - Select multiple entries by pressing and holding the <span class="uicontrol keyboard">CTRL</span> key and then selecting the data identifiers.

    - Use the search feature if you have a specific definition in mind. You can type the full or partial name of the data identifier.

    - Each template can contain a maximum of 30 data identifiers.

6.  To create a new expression, click **Expressions** and then click **Add new expression**. In the screen that appears, configure settings for the expression.

7.  To create a new file attribute list, click **File attributes** and then click **Add new file attribute**. In the screen that appears, configure settings for the file attribute list.

8.  To create a new keyword list, click **Keywords** and then click **Add new keyword**. In the screen that appears, configure settings for the keyword list.

9.  If you selected an expression, type the number of occurrences, which is the number of times an expression must occur before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a policy.

10. Choose a logical operator for each definition.

    :::note

    Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements. Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results. For examples of correct usage, see [Condition statements and logical pperators](condition-logical-operators.mdx).

11. To remove a data identifier from the list of selected identifiers, click the trash bin icon.
