# 4.1.1 - Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the `kubelet` service file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.

The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, the `kubelet` service file has permissions of 640.

### Audit {#audit}

Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the \<PATH\>/\<FILENAME\> of the kubelet service config file. Set $kubelet_service_config=\<PATH\> based on the file location on your system:

```bash
export
kubelet_service_config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf
```

To perform the audit manually, run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

```bash
stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
```

Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf
```
