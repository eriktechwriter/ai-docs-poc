# Enhanced Recommendation Scan for Server & Workload Security

Based on your system's required security rules, the scan delivers recommendations with optimized performance and fewer limitations. Whether run manually or scheduled for automated scanning, enhanced recommendation scan can apply recommended rules for regular protection with minimal disruption and reduced strain on system resources.
