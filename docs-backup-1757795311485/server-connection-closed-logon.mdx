# Server not found or connection closed upon console logon

Problem: An error message indicating server not found or connection closed appears when you log on to the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection management console.

The possible reason is as follows:

To improve customer security, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection decides to disable support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 and 1.1 and enable using TLS 1.2 only. What's more, Cloud App Security removes all weak SSL cipher suites. Therefore, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will not allow customers using TLS 1.0/1.1 or weak SSL cipher suites to access the management console.

Perform either of the following:

- For customers who use Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 or earlier, update your browser to meet the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection system requirements.

- For customers who use Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 on the Windows 7 and Windows 8 platforms, use other browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge to meet the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection system requirements.
