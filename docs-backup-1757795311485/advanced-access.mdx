# Advanced Access

:Access the full suite of Trend Vision One apps and features.

Advanced Access grants you access to the full suite of apps and features in the Trend Vision One console. Advanced Access is only available to organizations with Trend Vision One credits. Certain features within your Advanced Access entitlement require the allocation of credits. To learn more about credits, see [Introduction to credit-based licensing](introducing-credit-based-licensing.mdx).

:::note

If your company has purchased or renewed licenses for XDR sensors or other Trend Vision One services that support credit-based licensing, such licenses are automatically calculated into credits upon activation.

For more information, see [License entitlements calculated into credits](license-calculated-credits.mdx).

:::tip

If you currently have [Essential Access](essential-access.mdx) but require an Advanced Access app or feature, contact your sales representative. You might be eligible to receive a free 30-day Advanced Trend Vision One trial.
