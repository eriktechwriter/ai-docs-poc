# Use a template to create a custom filter

Use one of the pre-built filter templates to create a custom filter to detect events in your environment.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Agentic SIEM & XDR → Detection Model Management → Custom Filters → Use a template**.

2.  Browse the filter templates catalog, then select a template.

    **Detection Model Management** displays the custom filter in YAML format.

3.  Click **Next**.

4.  Adjust the general settings of the filter to your needs:

    - **Filter name**

    - **Description**

    - **Severity**

      A severity of medium, high, or critical affects the Cyber Risk Index on the [Cyber Risk Overview](executive-dashboard.mdx) and [Threat and Exposure Management](operations-dashboard.mdx). When testing or tuning a model, select low to avoid affecting indexes.

5.  Adjust the event settings of the filter to your needs:

    1.  Validate the query by clicking **Validate Query**.

        If the query is valid, you can click **Preview Search Results** to see the search results your query returns.

    2.  Specify up to 10 custom tags.

        Custom tags help you identify events detected by custom filters in **Workbench**, **Observed Attack Techniques**, and **XDR Data Explorer**.

        Tags can be up to 64 characters long.

6.  Click **Save**.

Trend Vision One saves and enables the custom filter. This action might require a few minutes before taking effect.

:::tip

You can use custom filters to [create detection models](configuring-custom-model.mdx) that generate Workbench alerts based on your detections.
