# View your intended credit usage in License Information

August 28, 2025—In License Information, you can now view the solutions that your organization intended to use credits for when purchasing a Trend Vision One Credits license. This enhancement enables you to see which specific solutions you intended to budget for, including the estimated units and number of credits you planned to use for each. You can view these details both on your license certificate and in License Information.
