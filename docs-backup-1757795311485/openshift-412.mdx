# 4.1.2 - Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1

Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, OpenShift sets the default user and group for the `kubelet.service` file to `root:root`.
:::

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command to list the user and group for the kubelet.service file on each node:

```bash
for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
         oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %U:%G
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
