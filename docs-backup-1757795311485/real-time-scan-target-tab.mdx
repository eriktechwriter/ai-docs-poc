# Real-time Scan: Target Tab

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Under **User Activity on Files**, choose activities on files that will trigger Real-time Scan. Select from the following options:

    - **Scan files being created/modified**: Scan new files introduced into the endpoint (for example, after downloading a file) or files being modified

    - **Scan files being retrieved/executed**: Scan files as they are opened

    - **Scan files being created/modified and retrieved/executed**

    - **Scan files being created/modified/executed**

    For example, if the third option is selected, a new file downloaded to the endpoint will be scanned and stays in its current location if no security risk is detected. The same file will be scanned when a user opens the file and, if the user modified the file, before the modifications are saved.

2.  Under **Scan Settings**, select one or more from the following options:

    - **Scan compressed files**: Scan individual files within an archive file

      For more information, see [Supported Compressed File Types](supported-compressed-file-types.mdx).

    - **Scan network drive**: Scan directories physically located on other endpoints, but mapped to the local endpoint
