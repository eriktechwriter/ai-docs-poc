## Data privacy {#data-privacy}

For general information on how Trend Micro protects your data, see the [Trend Micro Global Privacy Notice](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/about/trust-center/privacy/notice.mdx).

Depending on the nature of the protected environment and the object that is the target of the security event (for example, files, memory, network traffic) there is a risk that personal information may be collected within a security event. Security policy configuration and module selection are provided to meet the requirements of your target environment and minimize this risk.

For more information on the data sent to Trend Micro and customer controls over that data, please read the Trend Vision One Data Collection Notice.

## GDPR {#gdpr}

Trend Micro complies with applicable laws, including GDPR. For more information, see the [Trend Micro GDPR Compliance](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ca/about/trust-center/privacy/gdpr.mdx) site.

- Where appropriate, we implement Technical and Organization Measures ("TOMs") to support our processing of data under GDPR.

- As a data processor under GDPR, our processing of "personal data" is limited in a number of cases. The details on the data processed by Trend Vision One and the controls available to you over that data are documented in the Trend Vision One Data Collection Notice.

## Trend Vision One Data Collection Notice {#trend-vision-one-data-collection-notice}

Certain features available in Trend Vision One collect and send feedback regarding product usage and detection information to Trend Micro. For more information, see the Trend Vision One Data Collection Notice.

## Data security {#data-security}

Trend Micro adheres to industry standards for data security and provides an outline of general security practices. In addition, Trend Vision One uses industry-accepted best practices to secure your data. This includes segregating individual customer data as well as encrypting data at rest and data in transit. Backup of customer data follows industry-defined best practices and our various certifications such as ISO 27001 (for access control and cryptography) and ISO 27017 (for monitoring of cloud services and segregation of environments) help define our processes for backup and data recovery.

Customers can choose an available Trend Vision One region to provision the Trend Vision One console, and store and process all data lake services and data. Customers can assign roles to users which limit access rights to Trend Vision One, including but not limited to, granting support access, initiating response actions, collecting files from endpoints, and limiting users to read-only access.

Data at rest is protected by the native cloud technologies in the cloud on which it resides. Customer data is tagged with a “Customer ID” during ingestion as part of the data schema. The internal data access layer of Trend Micro applications requires this “Customer ID” parameter to access the data. This measure protects the customer data from being accessed by any other party as queries may only access one “Customer ID” at a time. Customers do not provide the “Customer ID” directly when interacting with the service; it is handled by the application itself. This ensures that there is no way for a malicious actor to pass the wrong customer ID to access another data set.

Trend Vision One uses TLS 1.2 wherever possible for data transmission.

Supported Ciphers:

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384

- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256

- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256

## Data segregation {#data-segregation}

All customer information is segregated to ensure that customers have access to only their own data. Customer data is tagged with a “Customer ID” during ingestion as part of the data schema. The internal data access layer of the Trend Micro application requires this “Customer ID” parameter to access the data. This measure protects the customer data from being accessed by any other party as queries may only have access to the specific “Customer ID” that the customer is authenticated to. Customers do not provide the “Customer ID” directly when interacting with the service, it is handled by the application itself. This ensures there is no way for a malicious actor to pass the wrong customer ID to access another data set.

Customer contact details, such as their email address, are encrypted at rest to ensure confidentiality. Data collected by Trend Vision One is listed in the Trend Vision One Data Collection Notice

## Data encryption {#data-encryption}

Information processed by Trend Vision One is encrypted both in transit, at rest and is sent to a Trend Vision One node in the region the customer selects during initial setup.

*At Rest*: Data at rest is protected by native cloud technologies to the cloud on which it resides. For Azure SQL, the database is encrypted by Transparent Database Encryption. Trend Micro's proprietary architecture within AWS utilizes native AES 256 encryption for the data lake contents at rest.

*In Transit*: Trend Vision One uses TLS 1.2 wherever possible for data transmission. Trend Micro manages the management console and client-server communication encryption for the customer using cloud-native key management infrastructure.

## Data access {#data-access}

All access to Trend Micro offices and networks is strictly controlled to authorized or accompanied individuals only. Access is given through a key card system and approval is required before entry is granted into sensitive areas. The Trend Vision One platform and data lake infrastructure reside within Microsoft Azure and AWS.

Trend Vision One is hosted in a highly restricted subnet with no direct internet access. Only a limited set of administrators have access to Trend Vision One for maintenance tasks. Operator access is done over secure encrypted connections and secured with multiple layers of network and access controls.

Access to information in Trend Vision One is restricted to Trend Micro Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), the threat research and analytics teams, and, when explicitly enabled in the console, the customer support teams. Access is allowed for the purposes of troubleshooting, solving issues, and improving the effectiveness of security protections. All access is recorded and audited. Access privileges are managed and approved by the product leadership team. Information in Trend Vision One may be accessed/viewed by the above Trend Micro teams from physical locations outside of the customer's deployed region.

Access is restricted to certain allowed IP addresses and is monitored in a SIEM. Alerts are generated for any suspicious access. Investigation of alerts is done according to incident management procedures.

Sub-contractors are not used in the development or operation of Trend Vision One.

## Security logs {#security-logs}

Trend Vision One uses the Trend Cloud One agent to monitor: Anti-Malware, Firewall, Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection. All access to the infrastructure is monitored and recorded through native security services offered by the Cloud Service provider.

Trend Vision One enables automated alerts and employs 24/7 on-call staff. Security alerts are reviewed for all systems on a daily basis. If a security incident is suspected, it is immediately reported to the Trend Micro Security Operations Center (SOC). Potential incidents are prioritized based on the severity of the suspected incident and a team from the SOC, as well as technical experts, is assigned to investigate.

These logs remain in the region that is hosting the Trend Vision One account and customers do not have access to these logs. For more information on what regions are covered by Trend Vision One, see [Trend Vision One Data Center Locations](https://success.trendmicro.com/en-us/solution/ka-0010805).

Audit Logs are generated and stored for all user access and actions in Trend Vision One systems. Trend Vision One retains the audit logs for 180 days. Customers can view customer access logs in their console, and can export them if needed.

## Data retention {#data-retention}

With regards to Log Retention, Trend Vision One applies retention policies that purge data once it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected. Trend Vision One retains the collected raw information for 30 days by default, unless the customer purchases an extended storage option. Trend Vision One also generates and retains alert workbenches for 180 days to give customers time for investigation/reporting. If a customer license expires, all data is deleted after a 30-day grace period.

## Data backup {#data-backup}

Trend Vision One backups are conducted daily. Automated tests are run weekly to validate the consistency of our backups and backups are stored to mitigate the risk of issues within a single region. Backups are kept for 35 days before they are destroyed.

## Disaster recovery and business continuity (DR) {#disaster-recovery-and-business-continuity-dr}

Trend Vision One has a disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity plan (BCP). A Disaster Recovery (DR) simulation is executed at least annually to verify the backup data and RTO/RPO claims under ISO 27001.

Backups are stored to mitigate the risk of issues within a single region. DR simulations are executed periodically to verify the data and RTO/RPO claims.

The Trend Vision One platform and data lake reside within Microsoft Azure and AWS. The Trend Vision One platform utilizes service-to-service connections to facilitate the operations of an advanced detection and response system.

## Change control {#change-control}

Ensuring that our customers continue to receive the latest security capabilities in a safe, reliable way is a key priority for our team. In addition to the development practices around code review, functional testing, and scale testing, as well as our vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, we take a number of steps to ensure that any service updates are introduced in a safe and controlled way. All service updates are introduced in small, incremental updates that are rolled out first to a staging environment and then to production. Each change is closely monitored and multiple procedures are in place, both automated and manual, to handle situations that may arise. All updates to the service are introduced transparently to customers, and can be rolled back transparently, should any unforeseen issues arise.

Application upgrades within the Trend Vision One environment are completed after meeting our quality objectives. Trend Micro uses best practices for changes, including full backups and approval processes. Trend Vision One has multiple dedicated development and testing environments. Any changes requested are first reviewed by technical stakeholders to determine the urgency and potential impact of the changes. All changes require a documented back-out plan. These changes are tracked and recorded in a change control system.

## Vulnerability management {#vulnerability-management}

Vulnerabilities are continuously monitored and tracked. Each vulnerability is assigned a CVSS score. Patching requirements that specify time frames for addressing a vulnerability according to CVSS-based severity are included in the Secure Development Compliance Policy. The Trend Vision One software in the Trend Vision One environment is updated once every two weeks to use the latest available code base, including vulnerability fixes. Trend Vision One team is responsible for patching the Trend Vision One software and supporting AWS and Microsoft Azure services.

## Code analysis {#code-analysis}

Trend Micro source code is scanned using static code analysis using industry-standard tools like Fortify, BlackDuck, and more, which are deployed at every development stage or phase. Also, Third-party vulnerabilities are scanned by industry-leading software monthly. Security testing, secure code review, and threat modeling are also part of the development lifecycle of all Trend Micro products.

Trend Vision One goes through strict quality checks from the development phase up to the GM release. After release, teams perform vulnerability scans weekly, in an automated fashion. The severity of vulnerabilities is rated using the CVSS score. Third-party penetration tests are conducted annually on the SaaS environment and cover application, external and internal network, and segmentation tests. Critical vulnerabilities are required to be fixed within one month or addressed through mitigation or workaround.

## Penetration testing {#penetration-testing}

The Trend Vision One platform undergoes regular security assessments, both automated and manual, including external 3rd-party assessments.

The Trend Vision One platform undergoes yearly penetration tests conducted by third-party security experts to detect and rectify common security issues. The scope of the third-party penetration tests includes application security tests, internal and external network scans, and network segmentation tests.
