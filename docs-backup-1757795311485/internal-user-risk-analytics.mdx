- Suspicious sign-in activities: sign-in activities with anomalous attributes, such as IP address, location, or browser

- Suspicious credential activities: activities indicating credential attack or compromise

- Suspicious user activities: unusual user behavior, such as abnormal permission assignment and suspicious access or configuration

- Admin confirmed user compromised: user compromise confirmed by administrators
