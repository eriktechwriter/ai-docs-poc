# Message size settings

Set the maximum message size that Cloud Email Gateway Protection can receive. Messages exceeding the specified size will be rejected.

You can specify a size between 10 to 50 MB or between 50 and 150 MB. Specifying a size between 50 and 150 MB requires that you enable advanced protection, which requires extra credit allocation.
