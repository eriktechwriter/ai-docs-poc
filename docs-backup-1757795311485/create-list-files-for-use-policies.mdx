# Create a list of files for use in policies

You can create lists of file paths so that you can use them in multiple policies. A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each created in a different policy. The most common use cases for these lists are for Anti-Malware scan inclusions or exclusions. For more information, see [Configure malware scan inclusions](configure-malware-scan-inclusions.mdx) and [Configure malware scan exclusions](configure-malware-scan-exclusions.mdx).

To create a file list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it.

The following table describes the syntax for defining file list items. The use of forward slashes and backslashes is supported for both Windows and Linux conventions.
