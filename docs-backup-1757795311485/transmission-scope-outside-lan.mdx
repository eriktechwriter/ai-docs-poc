# Transmission Scope: Only Transmissions Outside the Local Area Network

Data Loss Prevention monitors data transmitted to any target outside the Local Area Network (LAN).

:::note

Trend Micro recommends choosing this scope for internal agents.
:::

"Network" refers to the company or local network. This includes the current network (IP address of the endpoint and netmask) and the following standard private IP addresses:

- Class A: `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`

- Class B: `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`

- Class C: `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`

If you select this transmission scope, you can define the following:

- **Non-monitored targets**: Define targets outside the LAN that you consider safe and therefore should not be monitored.

  :::note

  Data transmissions to non-monitored targets and to monitored targets where "Monitor" is the action are similar in that the transmission is allowed. The only difference is that for non-monitored targets, Data Loss Prevention does not log the transmission, whereas for monitored targets, the transmission is always logged.
  :::

- **Monitored targets**: Define targets within the LAN that you want to monitor.

For guidelines on defining monitored and non-monitored targets, see [Defining Non-monitored and Monitored Targets](dac-channels-ntwk-targets.mdx).
