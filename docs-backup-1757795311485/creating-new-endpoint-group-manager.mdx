# Create a new Endpoint Group Manager

To better manage your endpoint policies and regions, you can use Product Instance to provision a new Endpoint Group Manager for your **Standard Endpoint Protection** agents.

Endpoint Group Managers help you manage policy deployment and load balancing for large groups of agents.

:::note

- Product Instance automatically provisions a new Windows and macOS instance for each Endpoint Group Manager.

- You can only move endpoints to different workgroups managed by the same Endpoint Group Manager. You cannot move agents from one Endpoint Group Manager to another.

- Each Standard Endpoint Protection Manager can have up to five Endpoint Group Managers, whether created in Product Instance or updated from a connected product.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Service Management â†’ Product Instance**.

2.  Under an existing Standard Endpoint Protection Manager, click **Endpoint Group Manager**.

3.  Define your new Endpoint Group Manager by specifying the required information.

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 80%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th><p>Setting</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Display name</p></td>
    <td><p>Unique name that identifies the Endpoint Group Manager in Product Instance and Standard Endpoint Protection</p>


    :::note

    <p>Maximum length of 100 characters and cannot contain: &lt;, &gt;, :, ", /, , |, ?, *, &amp;.</p>


    :::

    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Region</p></td>
    <td><p>The geographic location of the data center that hosts data being sent from endpoints to Trend Micro</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Description</p></td>
    <td><p>The purpose for the Protection Manager</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

4.  Click **Save**.

    Product Instance starts provisioning the new environment. This process might take a few minutes to complete. Once the process is finished, you can obtain Standard Endpoint Protection agent installation packages from Endpoint Inventory and start deploying to endpoints.
