# Using the quarantine action

Quarantined items are now stored in a directory structure created by Cloud Email Gateway Protection. This structure allows for increased performance when the service is saving items into quarantines or when users view them through the End User Console. Quarantined messages are indexed in the Cloud Email Gateway Protection database to provide you with queries and improved search tools.
