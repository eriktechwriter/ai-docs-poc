# Accounts with weak authentication

Weak authentication allows threat actors to use legitimate accounts to access systems and possibly steal sensitive information.

Authentication issues can result from unintentional misconfiguration of account settings or malicious behaviors involving Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID.

The following table outlines the actions you can perform on the widget:
