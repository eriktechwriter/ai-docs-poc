# Enhanced risk event filtering for Risk Event Response playbooks

May 19, 2025—Risk Event Response playbooks now support filtering by asset type to better target relevant risk events—except for the risk events associated with account compromise. Users can specify the asset type when configuring the playbook target and condition settings.
