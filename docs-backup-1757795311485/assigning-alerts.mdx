# Assign owners to Workbench alerts

Assign owners to your Workbench alerts so that your security team can track changes and receive notifications.

You can assign the following as owners of an alert:

- Users with a valid Trend Vision One account

- SAML groups

- SAML group members

- IdP-only SAML groups

- IdP-only SAML group members

You can assign multiple owners to one alert and you can assign owners to multiple alerts at once.

:::warning[Important]

Assigning owners has the following limitations:

- Adding new assignees overrides the current alert owners.

- For IdP-only SAML group users:

  - You can only assign users who have signed in and are still cached in Trend Vision One.

  - [User Accounts](user-accounts-foundation-services.mdx) cannot list all users under the IdP-only SAML group.

- *IdP-only SAML groups* and *IdP-only SAML group users* cannot get email notifications.
