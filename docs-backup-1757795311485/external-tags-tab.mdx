# External tags

Map your third-party tags to Trend Vision One tag properties for centralized tag management.

The **External tags** screen provides an overview of all your third-party mappings.

**External tags** supports the following mapping types:

- [Cloud mappings](create-cloud-mapping.mdx): Synchronize tag values from your cloud provider into Trend Vision One to group your cloud assets into cloud projects.
