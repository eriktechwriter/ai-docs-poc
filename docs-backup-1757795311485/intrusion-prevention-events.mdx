# Intrusion prevention events

For general best practices related to events, see [Events in Server & Workload Protection](event-logging.mdx).

To see the Intrusion Prevention events captured by Server & Workload Protection, go to **Events & Reports → Events → Intrusion Prevention Events**.

### What information is displayed for Intrusion Prevention events? {#what-information-is-displayed-for-intrusion-prevention-events}

These columns can be displayed on the Intrusion Prevention Events page. You can click *Columns* to select which columns are displayed in the table.

- *Time*: Time the event took place on the computer.
- *Computer*: The computer on which this event was logged. (If the computer has been removed, this entry will read "Unknown Computer".)
- *Reason*: The Intrusion Prevention rule associated with this event.
- *Tag(s)*: Any tags attached with the event.
- *Application Type*: The application type associated with the Intrusion Prevention rule which caused this event.
- *Action*: What action the Intrusion Prevention rule took (Block or Reset). If the rule is in *Detect Only* mode, the action is prefaced with "Detect Only:").- *Rank*: The ranking system provides a way to quantify the importance of Intrusion Prevention and firewall events. By assigning "asset values" to computers, and assigning "severity values" to Intrusion Prevention rules and firewall rules, the importance ("rank") of an event is calculated by multiplying the two values together. This allows you to sort events by rank when viewing Intrusion Prevention or firewall events.
- *Severity*: The Intrusion Prevention rule's severity value.
- *Direction*: The direction of the packet (incoming or outgoing).
- *Flow*: whether the packets(s) that triggered this event was travelling with ("Connection Flow") or against ("Reverse Flow") the direction of traffic being monitored by the Intrusion Prevention rule.
- *Interface*: The MAC address of the interface through which the packet was passing.
- *Frame Type*: The frame type of the packet in question. Possible values are "IPV4", "IPV6", "ARP", "REVARP", and "Other: XXXX" where XXXX represents the four digit hex code of the frame type.
- *Protocol*: Possible values are "ICMP", "ICMPV6", "IGMP", "GGP", "TCP", "PUP", "UDP", "IDP", "ND", "RAW", "TCP+UDP", AND "Other: nnn" where nnn represents a three digit decimal value.
- *Flags*: Flags set in the packet.
- *Source IP*: The packet's source IP.
- *Source MAC*: The packet's source MAC address.
- *Source Port*: The packet's source port.
- *Destination IP*: The packet's destination IP address.
- *Destination MAC*: The packet's destination MAC address.
- *Destination Port*: The packet's destination port.
- *Packet Size*: The size of the packet in bytes.
- *Repeat Count*: The number of times the event was sequentially repeated.
- *Time (microseconds)*: Microsecond resolution for the time the event took place on the computer.
- *Event Origin*: The Server & Workload Protection component from which the event originated.

The following columns are also available. They display information for events that are triggered from containers on computers that are protected by agent version 12 FR or newer:

- *Interface Type*: Container interface type.
- *Container Name*: Name of the container where the event occurred.
- *Container ID*: Container ID of the container where the event occurred.
- *Image Name*: Image name that was used to create the container where the event occurred.
- *RepoDigest*: A unique digest that identifies the container image.
- *Process Name*: Name of the process (from the container) that caused the event.

When [exporting](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security-events) Intrusion Prevention events, the exported data includes the fields listed above, as well as additional fields, which are not visible from the Server & Workload Protection console. The single exception is the *Severity* field, which is not available in the CSV file.

- *Note*: Meaningful string for the event, such as CVE code.
- *End Time*: Time the packet was most recently seen.
- *Position In Buffer*: Position in packet.
- *Position In Stream*: Position of packet in TCP/IP stream.
- *Data Flags*: Refer to the table below for details on Data Flags values:

- *Data Index*: A unique ID for packet data (dataId). All records with the same dataId are from the same packet.
- *Data*: Payload of the packet.
- *Original IP (XFF)*: Displays original IP address of the client. To obtain data for this field, enable the rule *1006450 - Enable X-Forwarded-For HTTP Header Logging*.

The following fields are also available. They display information for events that are triggered from containers on computers that are protected by agent version 12 FR or newer:

- *Process ID*: Process ID reported by the container.
- *Thread ID*: Thread ID reported by the container.
- *Image ID*: The local ID of the container image.
- *Pod ID*: The Pod ID (if applicable).
