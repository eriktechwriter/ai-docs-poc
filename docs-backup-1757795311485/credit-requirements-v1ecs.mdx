::Allocate Trend Vision One credits to enable the Email and Collaboration Security offerings.

### Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection {#cloud-email-and-collaboration-protection}

The following table describes the available Trend Vision One Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection offerings and required credits.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 67%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><p>Offering</p></th>
<th><p>Required credits</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Core protection</p></td>
<td><p>Core protection for your email and collaboration services, including services in Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, Box, and Dropbox</p>
<p>25 credits per user account</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Advanced protection</p></td>
<td><p>Advanced protection features including <a href="trend-vision-one-protection-modes-for-email-services">Inline Protection (for Exchange Online and Gmail)</a> and <a href="trend-vision-one-virtual-analyzer-cloud-apps">Virtual Analyzer for URLs</a> (URL sandboxing)</p>
<p>25 credits per user account</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The user accounts counted in the credit calculation are as follows:

- **Microsoft 365 services**: The deduplicated accounts that are added as targets of enabled policies for Exchange Online, OneDrive, or Teams Chat, excluding unlicensed and guest accounts

- **Microsoft 365 services (SharePoint Online or Teams only)**: The accounts that are synchronized from your organization's identity provider if only policies for SharePoint Online or Teams (Teams) are enabled.

- **Box, Dropbox, Gmail, Google Drive**: The deduplicated accounts that are added as targets of enabled policies for each service, excluding unlicensed and guest users.

- Policies include Advanced Threat Protection policies and Data Loss Prevention policies.

- For advanced protection charges, only accounts that are added in the policies with an advanced protection feature enabled are counted.

For example, your organization uses Exchange Online and SharePoint Online and has 500 users stored in Microsoft Entra ID. You add 100 users in several policies for Exchange Online without Virtual Analyzer for URLs enabled, another 100 users in other policies for Exchange Online with this feature enabled, and 2 SharePoint sites in several policies for SharePoint Online. The total number of credits required is calculated as follows: 25 \* 100 + (25 + 25) \* 100 = 7,500

Advanced protection charges occur when any of the advanced protection features is enabled. Enabling multiple features still costs 25 credits per user account. If you do not wish to use advanced protection, disable all advanced protection features and wait for at least one day. The deducted credits will be returned to your account.

:::warning[Important]

For customers having updated from Cloud App Security, if Virtual Analyzer for URLs was used in Cloud App Security, advanced protection is automatically enabled after the update, with credits for advanced protection automatically deducted.

Advanced protection charges occur when any of the advanced protection features is enabled and apply to all eligible user accounts or email addresses on all managed domains. Enabling multiple features still costs 25 credits per user account or email address.

For example, you have added 3 domains with 500 users in Cloud Email Gateway Protection, 300 of which are active user accounts over the past 30 days. You have enable URL sandboxing and Email Continuity on one domain, which means that advanced protection is enabled on all active user accounts of the three domains. Therefore, the total number of credits required is calculated as follows: (25 + 25) \* 300 = 15,000

If you do not wish to use advanced protection, disable all advanced protection features and wait for at least one day. The deducted credits will be returned to your account.

:::warning[Important]

For customers having updated from Trend Micro Email Security, if Email Encryption was used in Trend Micro Email Security, advanced protection is automatically enabled after the update, with credits for advanced protection automatically deducted.
:::

If you no longer need to use Cloud Email Gateway Protection, delete all managed domains in the [Domains](managing-domains.mdx) screen. All allocated credits will be returned to your account the next day.
