# Creating a Virtual Analyzer image deployment plan

Create an appliance plan to deploy prepared Virtual Analyzer images to Deep Discovery Inspector appliances.

Virtual Analyzer image plans allow you to deploy prepared Virtual Analyzer images to target appliances and configure the Virtual Analyzer instances.

Virtual Analyzer image plans can only be deployed to compatible appliances. If you are unable to select the target appliance you want to deploy the plan to, verify the version and configuration of the target appliance.

:::note

**Network Security** only supports appliance plans for Deep Discovery Inspector version 6.5 Patch 1 or later. Upgrade your appliances to the latest version to ensure you can deploy plans through **Network Security**.

The target appliance must be configured to use the internal Virtual Analyzer. Virtual Analyzer images cannot be deployed to a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance that is integrated with Deep Discovery Analyzer or Sandbox as a Service.

You must configure the Virtual Analyzer Image Source before deploying a Virtual Analyzer image plan.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Network Security → Network Inventory → Deep Discovery Inspector**.

2.  Click **Manage** and select **Appliance plans**.

3.  Create a plan.

    - To create a new plan, click **Add Plan** and select **Virtual Analyzer images**.

    - To copy a plan, select the plan you want to duplicate and click **Copy**.

4.  Specify a unique **Plan name**.

5.  Configure the **Virtual Analyzer images** settings.

    1.  Select the **Maximum images**.

    2.  Select the **OS type combination**.

    3.  Select the **Maximum instances**.

    4.  Click **Select Image**.

    5.  Select one or more images you want to deploy.

    6.  Click **Select**.

    :::note

    The selected image configuration replaces any configuration currently deployed on target appliances.

    To keep the images currently deployed on the target appliances, you must select the images as part of the configuration to deploy.
    :::

6.  Select one or more **Target appliances**.

    :::note

    The target appliance list only displays compatible Deep Discovery Inspector appliances. If the appliance you want to deploy the plan to does not appear on the list, you might need to update the appliance or review the system settings.
    :::

7.  Select the **Deployment schedule**.

    - **Immediate**: The plan begins deployment after saving.

    - **Custom**: The plan begins deployment at a specified time.

    If you select **Custom**, configure the deployment schedule settings to prevent the plan from executing at an unexpected time.

    - **Date**: The date to begin plan deployment.

    - **Package download period**: The time period when the target appliance can download the plan package.

    - **Execution start time**: When the target appliance executes the plan.

    :::note

    - Custom deployment schedules deploy based on the appliance system clock.

    - Plans are always deployed at 12:00 am (00:00) of the selected date.

    - If the download period includes 12:00 am (00:00) within the specified range - for example, if you set the download period to 8:00 pm (20:00) to 4:00 am (04:00) - the target appliance downloads as soon as the plan deploys. To prevent the download from occurring immediately, set the end time of the period to 11:59 pm (23:59).
    :::

8.  (Optional) Specify a **Description** of the plan.

9.  Click **Save**.
