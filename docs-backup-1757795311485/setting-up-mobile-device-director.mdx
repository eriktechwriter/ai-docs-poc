        **Mobile Security** can access your Microsoft Entra ID data in one tenant only. To allow **Mobile Security** to access Microsoft Entra ID data in another tenant, block permissions on the current tenant and grant permissions on a new tenant in the **Microsoft Entra ID** section of the **Third-Party Integration** app.
