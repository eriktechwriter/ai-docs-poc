# Zero Trust Secure Access enables additional authentication to Private Access

February 26, 2024—Users may now require additional authentication to Private Access after authenticating on endpoints with the Secure Access Module. Enabling the new feature overrides the default behavior of authenticating users to Internet Access and Private access at the same time, allowing for the use of Private Access only on demand. For more Information, see [Secure Access Module](secure-access-module.mdx).
