# Forward Proxy Service

Specify the Trend Micro services that your on-premises Trend Micro products can access through the Forward Proxy Service.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation â†’ Service Gateway Management**.

2.  Click the name of the Service Gateway appliance with **Forward Proxy Service** installed.

3.  In the **Installed Services** list, locate **Forward Proxy Service** and click the configure icon (![](/images/configure=GUID-657DB993-ADC7-4DEC-8C62-C8739D74760E.webp)).

4.  In the **Forward Proxy Service** panel, select whether you allow your on-premises Trend Micro products to access only specified Trend Micro services through the Forward Proxy Service.

    The Forward Proxy Service comes with a list of [predefined allowed Trend Micro services](predefined-allow-list.mdx) in "FQDN and port" pair, as well as services submitted via API. You can also add allowed services as needed.

5.  Click **Add**, and then specify the FQDN, IP address, or CIDR, as well as the port number of an allowed Trend Micro service.

    You can only modify service information that is added manually or via API.

    :::warning[Important]

    Trend Micro recommends keeping the predefined allowed services. Deleting these services might interference with the normal operations of the associated Trend Vision One features and apps.
    :::

6.  Repeat step 5 to add more allowed services.

7.  In the **Custom Port** section, configure a custom port for the Forward Proxy Service if the default port (8080) is restricted or already in use in your network environment.

    The following Trend Micro services currently support custom ports:

    - Server & Workload Protection (Windows/Linux ) version 20.0.1.9400 or later

    - Standard Endpoint Protection (Windows) version 14.0.13139 or later

    - Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent June 2024 release or later

    - Trend Micro Endpoint Basecamp

    - Apex One as a Service

    - Trend Vision One Mobile Security

    - Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector

    - Trend Micro Deep Discovery Email Inspector 5.1.0 3342 or later

    - TXOne StellarOne

    - TXOne EdgeOne

    :::note

    The Deep Security Agent does not support custom ports. If you need to use a non-default port, upgrade to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security - Server & Workload Protection, which supports custom ports for the Forward Proxy Service.

    For more information, see [Upgrade to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security - Server & Workload Protection](https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/20_0/on-premise/migration.mdx) and [Integrate Workload Security with Trend Vision One](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security-xdr).
    :::

    :::warning[Important]

    Changing the port might temporarily interrupt the connection with Trend Micro services if the Service Gateway is the only configured proxy for your connected Trend Micro products. Ensure you have a secondary Service Gateway or fallback mechanism in place before applying changes.

    For guidance on safely changing the port, see [Best practices for changing the port](best-practices-for-changing-port.mdx).
