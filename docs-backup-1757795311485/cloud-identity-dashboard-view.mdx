# Misconfiguration and Compliance

When you first log in to Trend Vision One â€“ Cloud Risk Management, you will be directed to the overview where you can navigate your cloud accounts.

The Misconfiguration and Compliance provides high-level metrics on all your cloud accounts, not only individually, but also when viewed together or as a user-defined [Group](grouped-accounts.mdx). These metrics are organized into dashboard sections, and include:

- [Summary section](summary-widget-cloud-posture.mdx) - overall compliance score of your account(s) and check summaries
- Account and Group Comparison section - compare compliance scores of accounts and groups
- [Threat monitoring section](threat-monitoring-section.mdx) - real-time monitoring of user activities and events in the selected AWS account
- Cost monitoring section - an overview of costs incurred and forecasted costs
- [Compliance status section](compliance-status-widget.mdx) - current compliance scores of account(s) based on five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework
- [Compliance evolution](compliance-evolution.mdx) - change in compliance scores of account(s) over the last 30 days
- [Status per AWS region](status-per-aws-region.mdx) - identify AWS regions that are the most vulnerable
- [Most critical failures](most-critical-failures.mdx) - sorted by associated risk level

You will also be able to access package add-on functionality for your account(s) subscriptions.

Example: Dashboard with an Account selected that has [Real Time Posture Monitoring](real-time-threat-monitoring.mdx) and Cost Optimisation add-ons enabled.
