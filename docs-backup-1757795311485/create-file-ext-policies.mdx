# Create a list of file extensions for use in policies

Create lists of file extensions so that you can use them in multiple malware scan configurations. A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each created in a different rule. For example, one list of file extensions can be used by multiple malware scan configurations as files to include in a scan. Another list of file extensions can be used by multiple malware scan configurations as files to exclude from a scan.

:::tip

To create a file extension list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it.

You can insert comments into your list by preceding the text with a pound sign ("#").
