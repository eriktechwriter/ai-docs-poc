# Files Infected with Trojans

Trojans are programs that perform unexpected or unauthorized, usually malicious, actions such as displaying messages, erasing files, or formatting disks. Trojans do not infect files, thus cleaning is not necessary.

Solution: The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent uses the Damage Cleanup Engine and Damage Cleanup Template to remove Trojans.
