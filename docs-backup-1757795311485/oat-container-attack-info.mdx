# Observed Attack Techniques offers visibility into container attack information

August 15, 2023—To facilitate the visibility of container attacks, the Observed Attack Techniques app has been updated to show all detected events with filter hits originating from container security point products. The app now lists the container name or ID under **Associated Entity**, providing customers with immediate insight into which entity was targeted. Customers are able to search events by container name, in addition to the existing search criteria.
