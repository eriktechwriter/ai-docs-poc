# Authorized account

An authorized account is an email address that is associated with an administrator. Through this account, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection is granted the ability to access a protected cloud application or service.

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection creates an Authorized Account, which is based upon OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization, to obtain an access token for limited access to the cloud application or service on administrators' behalf without requiring their passwords. OAuth is an open authorization standard used to provide secure client application access to server resources.

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection uses access tokens to:

- Access user accounts designated for protection and "listens" for users uploading, creating, or modifying files

- Access mailbox accounts designated for protection and "listens" for arriving email messages

- Access profiles designated for protection and "listens" for users updating object records, for example, attachments, feed posts and comments

- Access user accounts designated for protection and "listens" for users sending private Teams chat messages
