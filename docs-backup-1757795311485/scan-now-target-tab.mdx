# Scan Now: Target Tab

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **Files to Scan** section, select from the following:

    - **All scannable files**: Includes all scannable files. Unscannable files are password protected files, encrypted files, or files that exceed the user-defined scanning restrictions.

      :::note

      This option provides the maximum security possible. However, scanning every file requires a lot of time and resources and might be redundant in some situations. Therefore, you might want to limit the amount of files the agent includes in the scan.
      :::

    - **File types scanned by IntelliScan**: Scans files based on true-file type.

    - **Files with the following extensions (use commas to separate entries)**: Manually specify the files to scan based on their extensions. Separate multiple entries with commas.

      :::note

      When configuring a parent policy, specify how other users can configure child policies.

      - **Inherit from parent**: Child policies must use the settings configured in the parent policy

      - **Extend from parent**: Child policies can append additional settings to the settings inherited from the parent policy
      :::

2.  In the **Scan Settings** section, configure the required settings.

    :::note

    <p>Scanning through more layers may detect malware intentionally buried within a compressed archive, however, the scan may affect system performance.</p>

    <p>The specified number of layers is applicable to both the <strong>Scan OLE objects</strong> and <strong>Detect exploit code in OLE files</strong> options.</p>

3.  In the **CPU Usage** section, select from the following:

    - **High**: No pausing between scans

    - **Medium**: Pause between file scans if CPU consumption is higher than 50%, and do not pause if 50% or lower

    - **Low**: Pause between file scans if CPU consumption is higher than 20%, and do not pause if 20% or lower
