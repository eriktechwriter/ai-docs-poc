# Key attack path components

Learn about the types of components found in potential attack paths and common component characteristics.

A potential attack path contains:

- Entry point assets with risk detections indicating the asset is vulnerable to compromise

  - Entry point assets are typically accessible from the internet or displaying signs of potential compromise.

- A potential path for lateral movement that could allow attackers to reach critical assets using asset relationships

  - Relationships are determined by analyzing the following:

    - Network activities

    - User activities

    - Administrative actions

    - Permissions

    - Cloud asset traffic

- High-value critical assets that serve as desirable target points for attackers

  - Asset criticality is determined based on asset attributes, represented by platform tags assigned to the asset such as job role, device ownership, or device type. For more information about platform tags, see [Asset profile platform tags](asset-profile-tags.mdx).

  - You may set a custom criticality level for an asset from the asset profile page if you feel the level assigned by Trend Vision One is insufficient. For information on specific asset profile screen types, see [Asset profile screens](asset-profile-screens.mdx).

:::note

In certain cases, an asset may serve as the entry and target point for an attack path, so no lateral movement path is required.

The tables below provide examples and descriptions of common attack path component characteristics that may be displayed in a potential attack path.
