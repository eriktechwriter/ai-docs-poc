# Expressions

An expression is data that has a certain structure. For example, credit card numbers typically have 16 digits and appear in the format "nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn", making them suitable for expression-based detections.

Administrators can use predefined and customized expressions.

For details, see [Predefined Expressions](predefined-expressions.mdx) and [Customized Expressions](customized-expressions.mdx).
