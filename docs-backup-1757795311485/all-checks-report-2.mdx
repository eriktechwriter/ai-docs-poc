# All checks report

The All Checks report provides the success and failure of all Rules enabled and active on your Account, Group, or Organisation. These can be viewed by *Rule,* *Resource,* or [Compliance Standard](compliance-reports.mdx) to prioritize [failed checks for resolution](failed-check-resolution.mdx). You can also view all excluded resources in your account.

We also provide users with options to :

1.  Generate [Configured reports](configured-reports.mdx)
2.  [Filter checks](filter-search.mdx)
3.  [Generate report](generate-download-report.mdx)
4.  [Resolve the failures](failed-check-resolution.mdx)
5.  On clicking the expand button
    1.  [Send rule to](send-rule.mdx)
    2.  [Configure rule](rules-configuration.mdx)
    3.  [Suppress](rules-suppress-check.mdx)
    4.  Create tickets depending on the [communication channels](communication-integrations.mdx) configured
