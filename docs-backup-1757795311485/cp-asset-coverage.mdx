# Asset Coverage

The Asset Coverage widget offers a detailed overview of your cloud accounts, categorized by cloud provider. It also indicates the number of accounts with Trend Vision One capabilities enabled, including Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection and [Real-Time Posture Monitoring](real-time-threat-monitoring.mdx). This widget helps you ensure comprehensive security coverage across your cloud environment, allowing you to easily identify and address any gaps.

From the Asset Coverage widget, you can:

- Click **Manage cloud accounts** to open the Cloud Accounts page, where you can add cloud accounts, view existing accounts, and enable features on cloud accounts.

- In the Cloud provider table, click a cloud provider name to view a list of accounts associated with that provider on the Cloud Accounts page.

- In the Capability table, click a Trend Vision One feature to see a list of cloud accounts using that feature on the Cloud Accounts page and assess whether you need to enable that feature on other cloud accounts.
