# Granting permissions on Microsoft Entra ID data

Grant Trend Micro permission to access your Microsoft Entra ID data.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the Trend Vision One console, access the Microsoft Entra ID integration configuration screen.

    - If this is the first time you set up Mobile Security, go to **Mobile Security → Mobile Inventory** to display the **Mobile Security** landing page.

      Under **I don’t have an MDM solution**, click **Set Up Mobile Security**. On the screen that appears, click **Use mobile security functions only** at the bottom.

    - If you have already set up an MDM integration or Mobile Device Director, go to **Mobile Security → Mobile Inventory**, click the settings icon (![](/images/integrationSettings=20250121101015.webp)), and click **Add MDM Solution**.

      Under **I don’t have an MDM solution**, choose **Select an MDM solution → Microsoft Entra ID**.

    - Go to **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration**, and click **Microsoft Entra ID** in the integration list.

2.  In the **Status** column, locate the Microsoft Entra ID tenant that you want to grant permissions on, and then click **Grant permissions** for the **Mobile Security** app.

3.  Sign in to Microsoft Entra ID with an administrator account that manages the Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

4.  Review the permissions required and click **Accept**.

    When permissions are successfully granted, the tenant name appears in **User Configuration**.

    **Mobile Security** can access your Microsoft Entra ID data in the target tenant and send device enrollment invitations to the end users.

    **Mobile Security** can access your Microsoft Entra ID data in one tenant only. To allow **Mobile Security** to access Microsoft Entra ID data in another tenant, block permissions on the current tenant and grant permissions on a new tenant in the **Microsoft Entra ID** section of the **Third-Party Integration** app.

5.  Click **Go back to Mobile Security**.

    **Mobile Security** can access your Microsoft Entra ID data in the target tenant and send device enrollment invitations to the end users.

    :::note

    **Mobile Security** can access your Microsoft Entra ID data in one tenant only. To allow **Mobile Security** to access Microsoft Entra ID data in another tenant, block permissions on the current tenant and grant permissions on a new tenant in the **Microsoft Entra ID** screen of the **Third-Party Integration** app.
