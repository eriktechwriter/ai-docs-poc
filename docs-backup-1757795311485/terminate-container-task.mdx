# Terminate Container task

Stop suspicious behavior of containers within a pod by terminating the pod using context menus on the Trend Vision One console.

This task is supported by the following services:

- Trend Vision One Container Security

:::warning[Important]

- Only currently running Kubernetes pods or ECS tasks are supported for the **Terminate Container** task.

- Terminating a pod destroys evidence of the suspicious behavior and does not prevent the behavior from happening again. If possible, run the [Isolate Container](isolate-container-task.mdx) task before deciding to terminate a container.
:::

The **Terminate Container** task allows you to stop the spread of suspicious behavior within a container by terminating the containing pod. Once terminated, a pod cannot be resumed. Start the task using context menus on the Trend Vision One console.
