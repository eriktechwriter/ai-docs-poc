# Audit logs for computers removed by inactive agent removal

Check the audit trail for computers removed by an inactive cleanup job.

When Trend Vision One removes inactive agents, Server & Workload Protection generates system events for those computers managed by the Protection Manager. You can use the **Advanced Search** in **Events and Reports** to track removed computers by searching for the event ID.

The following table details the relevant events. For more information, see [System events](system-events.mdx).
