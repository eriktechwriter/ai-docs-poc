# Filters

Filters automatically group users or endpoints having the same criteria.

- You can group **Users** and **Endpoints** based on custom filters and importance.

  For more information, see [Creating a Custom Filter](creating-a-custom-filter-saas.mdx) and [User or Endpoint Importance](user-or-endpoint-importance.mdx).

- In addition, the **Endpoints** tree can group endpoints based on default filters.

  For more information, see [Default Endpoint Filters](default-endpoint-tree-filters.mdx).

- Any Trend Micro Apex Central user account that has permission to create or modify custom tags, filters, or important labels in the **User/Endpoint Directory** can view or modify custom tags, filters, or important labels created by all other user accounts.
