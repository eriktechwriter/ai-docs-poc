# Managed Mobile Apps

Manage the apps used by your organization for work purposes

As part of the MDM functionality provided, Mobile Device Director enables you to install and control the mobile apps used in your organization. You can assign the app to groups and configure app settings, such as the availability of an app to specific end users, the app install type, and app permissions to access device features.

The following table outlines the actions available on the **Managed Mobile Apps** screen (**Mobile Security â†’ Managed Mobile Apps**).
