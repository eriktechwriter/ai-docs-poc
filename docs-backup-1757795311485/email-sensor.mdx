# Email and Collaboration Sensor

:Manage Email Sensor for email accounts and Collaboration Sensor for Microsoft 365 accounts in your environment, and quickly validate the Email and Collaboration Security solutions by running email simulations in your environment.

**Email and Collaboration Sensor** allows you to manage the Trend Vision One Email Sensor and Collaboration Sensor in your environment.

After deploying Email Sensor for your email service, you can enable email sensor detection and response for email accounts. Email sensor detection and response sends activity data to Trend Vision One for state-of-the-art threat detection and alerting.

After deploying Collaboration Sensor for your Microsoft 365 services, including SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Teams Chat, Collaboration Sensor collects the activity data of Microsoft 365 accounts in your organization and sends the data to Trend Vision One. Administrators can search for the collaboration activity data in **XDR Data Explorer** and export the data using the [Datalake Pipeline APIs](https://automation.trendmicro.com/xdr/api-v3).

:::warning[Important]

Collaboration Sensor for Microsoft 365 is a pre-release feature and is not part of the existing features of an official commercial or general release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature. There is no additional charge for pre-release features before official release.
