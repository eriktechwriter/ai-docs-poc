# Managing email account policies with Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection

Protect the email accounts in your email service by deploying Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection policies to the accounts.

Deploy Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection policies to email accounts to provide complete protection over your email assets.

You can view the total number of email accounts without assigned policies from Cyber Risk Overview by going to **Cyber Risk Overview → Security Configuration → Email Security** and reviewing the widgets.

- On the **Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection** widget, click on the total number of email accounts with no policy to open a list in Email Asset Inventory of email accounts without Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) policies enabled.

- On the **Key Feature Adoption Rates** widget, expand a feature and click on the number of email accounts with either the *Partially enabled* or *Disabled* status to open a list of those email accounts in Email Asset Inventory.

Otherwise, you can use the **Add filters** icon (![](/images/filter_EAI=GUID-F4C35A81-71B3-4520-A5D1-1A35CB273B5C=en-us=.webp)) in Email Asset Inventory to locate email accounts you want to deploy or manage policy settings.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Email and Collaboration Security Operations → Email Asset Inventory**.

2.  Locate and select the target email accounts.

3.  Click **Manage Policy**.

    The **Manage Policy** screen opens.

      <p>Select the option and click <strong>Enable Default ATP Policy</strong>.</p>
      <p>The default ATP policy protects all the accounts in your organization, including the selected accounts. It has the lowest priority and does not affect the protection you have configured for other accounts.</p></td>

      <tr>
      <td><p>Configure custom ATP policies</p></td>
      <td><p>Allows you to add the selected accounts to existing custom policies or create a new policy for the these accounts</p>
      <p>Select the option and click <strong>Go to ATP Policies</strong> to open the Advanced Threat Protection policies list in a new browser tab.</p>
