# Adding a SAML Group Account for Active Directory (on-premises)

Invite all users in an Active Directory (on-premises) group to sign in to the Trend Vision One console using their identities in the IdP solution.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Make sure that Active Directory Federation Services is configured in **Administration → Identity Providers** to set up SSO authentication between Active Directory (on-premises) and Trend Vision One.

    For details, see [Configure Active Directory Federation Services](configuring-adfs.mdx).

2.  Make sure that you have set up connection with Active Directory (on-premises) in **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration** to synchronize group data from the identity provider.

    For details, see [Active Directory (on-premises) integration](ad-premises-integration.mdx).

3.  Go to **Administration → User Accounts**.

4.  Click **Add User Account**.

5.  Select **SAML Group**.

6.  Select **Active Directory (on-premises)** from the **Identity provider** drop-down list box.

7.  Enter the email address of a group in Active Directory (on-premises).

8.  Enter the name of the group.

9.  Select a Trend Vision One role to assign to the users in the group.

    To create a custom user role, click **Create a custom role in User Roles**. For more information, see [User Roles](user-roles-foundation-services.mdx).

    :::note

    Creating a custom role leaves the current screen and discards all changes made in the screen.

10. Add some description about the SAML group.

11. Click **Add**.

    The group and its members appear in the **User Accounts** list.

12. Make sure that group users verify their email addresses.

    Users who need to verify their email addresses have an email sent icon (![](/images/verify_email=765a7beb-7f89-425f-bc96-850966cec0cf.webp)) in the **Status** column.

    :::note

    - Users must verify their email addresses to be able to sign in to Trend Vision One.

    - The verification link expires after 24 hours. If the verification link expires, any account with the **Configure account settings** permission can resend the verification email.

    - If one or more of your domains have been verified using [Domain Verification](domain-verification.mdx), all SAML users or user group members under a verified domain can be added directly without the need to verify email addresses.

13. (Optional) When editing an account, enable or disable the account by clicking the toggle in the **Status** column.
