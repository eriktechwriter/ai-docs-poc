# Server & Workload Protection agent deployment

Configure your Server & Workload Protection agent installation packages to ensure that your newly-deployed agents:

- Report to the correct Server & Workload Protection Manager

- Automatically apply the correct default settings

:::note

Trend Micro recommends that you configure a [default policy](create-policies.mdx) and use the [agent-initiated activation](agent-initiated-activation.mdx) feature before deploying agent packages to simplify the connection process.

1.  Go to **Endpoint Security â†’ Endpoint Inventory**.

4.  Specify the package type.

    - **Auto detect**: The installation package is light-weight, and downloads and installs additional components after detecting the operating system type (requires more network bandwidth)

    - **Full package**: The installation package contains all necessary components and automatically installs the correct components after detecting the operating system version

5.  Select the **Server & Workload Protection Manager** that the newly-deployed agents report to.
