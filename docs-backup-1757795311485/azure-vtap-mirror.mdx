# Setting up traffic mirroring with Azure virtual network TAP

Learn how to configure traffic mirroring for your Virtual Network Sensor with Microsoft Azure virtual network TAP.

Trend Micro recommends configuring traffic mirroring with Azure virtual network TAP. For more information, see the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-tap-overview).

You can also configure traffic mirroring with [Gigamon VUE Cloud Suite for Azure](gigamon-vue-cloud-suite-azure.mdx). Gigamon is a third-party provider recommended by Microsoft for use in the Azure environment, and has been tested by Trend Micro for use with the Virtual Network Sensor.
