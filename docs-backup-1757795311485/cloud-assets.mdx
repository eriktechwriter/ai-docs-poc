# Cloud assets

Gain comprehensive visibility over your organization's cloud environment and identify cloud assets with potential security vulnerabilities.

**Attack Surface Discovery** detects the various assets in your environment based on data from your connected cloud accounts. Trend Vision One categorizes and assigns risk scores to each cloud asset. The **Cloud Assets** section of **Attack Surface Discovery** provides a consolidated overview of your cloud assets to help you quickly identify potential vulnerabilities and continuously assess and prioritize risk.

The following table describes the actions available in the **Cloud Assets** section of **Attack Surface Discovery**.
