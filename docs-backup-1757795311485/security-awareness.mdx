# Security Awareness

Create phishing simulations to identify users who may need to strengthen their cybersecurity knowledge, and track the progress of training campaigns to educate your users about cyber threats.

Use **Security Awareness** to run phishing simulations and create training campaigns to educate your users about common attack methods used by cybercriminals. Phishing Simulations and Training campaigns work together to give your users the knowledge they need to stand as the first line of defense against cyber threats.

The following table describes the features available in **Security Awareness**.
