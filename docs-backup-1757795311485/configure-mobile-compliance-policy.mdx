# Configuring mobile compliance policies

Use compliance policies to flag devices that do not meet the specified criteria and potentially perform automatic actions on noncompliant devices.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Mobile SecurityMobile Compliance Policies**.

2.  On the **Mobile Compliance Policies** screen, click **Create** and choose the operating system you want this compliance policy to apply to.

    You can only create compliance policies per operating system and settings differ based on operating system.

3.  Under **General**, specify a policy name of 1 to 30 characters, type a policy description, and click **Next**.

    For Android devices, you also select a **Device type**:

    - User-owned devices with a work profile

    - Company-owned, fully-managed and dedicated devices

4.  Under **Compliance Settings**, specify the compliance policy criteria and click **Next**.

    :::note

    Devices that match the criteria specified here are deemed compliant.
    :::

    Refer to the following topics to find the available compliance criteria for each operating system and device type:

    - [Android compliance policy criteria (user-owned devices with a work profile)](android-compliance-user-owned.mdx)

    - [Android compliance policy criteria (company-owned, fully managed, and dedicated devices)](android-compliance-policy-dedicated.mdx)

    - [iOS compliance policy criteria](ios-compliance-criteria.mdx)

5.  Under **Actions**, specify the actions to apply automatically to noncompliant devices and click **Next**.

    By default, each device compliance policy includes the action to mark a device as noncompliant if it fails to meet the criteria.

6.  Under **Assignment**, assign the policy to your assignment groups by selecting one or more groups and clicking **Save**.

    The users or devices targeted by your policy are evaluated for compliance when they check in with **Mobile Security**.
