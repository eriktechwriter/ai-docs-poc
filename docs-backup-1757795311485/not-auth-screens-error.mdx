# Not authorized to view content error upon accessing certain screens

Problem: You get the error "You are not authorized to view the content. For more information, contact your system administrator." when trying to access certain screens on the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection console.

The possible causes are as follows:

- Possible cause 1: You do not have permission to access the screen.

  Ask your system administrator to grant you the view or full access permission on the screen.

- Possible cause 2: You try to access the "Administration" screen but do not have the Global administrator role.

  Ask your system administrator to assign you the Global administrator role.

- Possible cause 3: You try to access the classic console, but are not authorized to manage all organizations.

  Ask your system administrator to allow you to manage all organizations.
