# Configuring graymail criteria

Graymail refers to solicited bulk email messages that do not fit the definition of spam email messages. Cloud Email Gateway Protection detects marketing messages and newsletters, social network notifications, forum notifications, and bulk email messages as graymail messages.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select “**Graymail**”.

2.  Click **Graymail**.

    The **Graymail Detection Setting** screen appears.

3.  Select at least one graymail category from the following:

    - **Marketing message and newsletter**

    - **Social network notification**

    - **Forum notification**

    - **Bulk email message**

4.  To omit the IP addresses of specific mail servers from this policy rule, select **Enable the graymail exception list** under **Graymail Exception List**.

5.  Specify IP addresses that you want to bypass graymail scanning.

    :::note

    The policy rule will not apply to graymail messages from IP addresses in this exception list. The list is specific just to the policy rule being edited.
