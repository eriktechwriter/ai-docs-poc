### SNS Notification Attributes {#sns-notification-attributes}

- *failureDiscoveryDate :* the date of failure discovery. A failure can be discovered either when the check was originally created or when a check status was updated from SUCCESS to FAILURE. Example: if a check is created today, "Failure discovery date" is set to today. If a check exists and was successful, but changed to a failure today, "Failure discovery date" is set to today.
- *lastUpdatedDate :* the timestamp of the last time Cloud Risk Management Scan or RTPM updated any attribute of the check.
- *lastStatusUpdateDate :* the timestamp of the last time Cloud Risk Management Scan or RTPM updated status attribute of the check. For new checks, this field is set to the creation date.
- *lastModifiedBy :* AWS Identity of the user that caused an event that RTPM picked up and either created a new check in FAILURE status or updated an existing check with SUCCESS to FAILURE.
- *lastModifiedDate:* the timestamp of when *lastModifiedBy* is set.

### FAQs {#faqs}

\*\*We currently have a python Slackbot that can alert each user directly. Does Cloud Risk Management have a way to send alerts as SQS message so that it can be picked up by our Slackbot?\*\*Yes, follow the steps below:

1.  Set up an Amazon SNS channel
2.  Subscribe to SNS and add SQS endpoint

\*\*Can integration be built into Atlassian OpsGenie?\*\*OpsGenie has a [native SNS integration](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/amazon-sns-incoming-integration). Therefore, notifications created in SNS will automatically be created in OpsGenie through the integration.
