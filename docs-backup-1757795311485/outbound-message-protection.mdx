# Outbound message protection

Cloud Email Gateway Protection scans outgoing email messages before delivery if outbound filtering is enabled. Cloud Email Gateway Protection applies the following policies for filtering:

- Malware (viruses, spyware, and so on)

- Spam and phishing

- Web reputation

- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- Transport Layer Security (TLS) check

- DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signing

In addition, outbound encryption is seamlessly integrated with the content-filtering capabilities of Cloud Email Gateway Protection, using policy-based encryption to secure email messages. The service does not automatically encrypt email messages. When outbound filtering is enabled, outbound encryption appears as a policy option within the Cloud Email Gateway Protection administrator console. You will need to configure policy rules that apply encryption as a rule action.

To learn about the policy rule used to encrypt outbound messages, see [Encrypting outbound messages](encrypting-outbound-messages.mdx). To learn more about how to enable outbound protection for a managed domain, see step 5 in [Adding a domain](adding-domain.mdx).

Cloud Email Gateway Protection evaluates outgoing messages against regulatory compliance templates defined in DLP policies to prevent data leakage. For details about DLP, see [Data Loss Prevention](data-loss-prevention-email-security.mdx).
