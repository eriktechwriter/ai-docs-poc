# Add contacts - users who can only receive reports

:Contacts are users who cannot sign in to the Trend Micro Cloud One console but can periodically be sent reports from Server & Workload Protection (using scheduled tasks). Contacts can be assigned a "clearance" level that maps to existing roles. When a contact is sent a report, the report will contain only information that would be accessible to a user of the same level. For example, three contacts may be listed as the recipients of a weekly summary report, but the contents of the three reports could be entirely different for each contact depending on their computer rights.

:::note

Most users are managed through [Trend Micro Cloud One User Management](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/management/users), which applies to all parts of Trend Micro Cloud One, but contacts are managed specifically through Server & Workload Protection.
