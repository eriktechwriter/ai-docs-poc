# Selecting a risk reduction goal

Select a risk reduction goal or set your own goal and remediate risk events with the highest impact on the Cyber Risk Index.

Risk reduction goals offer a structured approach to reducing your Cyber Risk Index. Predefined goals let you lower your risk level, reduce your Cyber Risk Index to the industry average, or focus on top risks. You can also set your own goal that meets your requirements. The goal preview displays an estimate of the Cyber Risk Index reduction after achieving the specified goal.

When you remediate risk events, the Cyber Risk Index decreases by the sum of the amounts equivalent to the events' impact score to achieve the selected risk reduction goal. For more information about the Cyber Risk Index algorithm, see [January 29, 2024 - Cyber Risk Index algorithm version 2.0](risk-index-algorithm-v2.mdx). However, the actual Cyber Risk Index after reduction could fluctuate around your desired goal as Trend Vision One keeps collecting and assessing new events while you complete remediation actions.

For example, you set your own goal to a desired Cyber Risk Index of 45 from the current 70, and there are five risk events that you need to address. While you are resolving the five events, if no new high-impact events are assessed and included in the Cyber Risk Index calculation, the Cyber Risk Index decreases to 45 or less. Otherwise, the Cyber Risk Index might increase to a higher value based on the impact score of any new events, which are listed in the table.

The Cyber Risk Index automatically updates every four hours. Changes to the status of risk events are reflected in the Cyber Risk Index after up to one hour. You may also manually recalculate the Cyber Risk Index by clicking the **Recalculate** button. Manual recalculations take up to one hour to display.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Threat and Exposure Management**.

2.  In the **Risk Reduction Measures** section, click **Select a Goal**.

3.  In the **Risk Reduction Goal** dialog, view the available options and how each goal can help on reducing your Cyber Risk Index, and then select a goal.

4.  Check the Cyber Risk Index reduction estimate, including the target Cyber Risk Index, the number of risk events you need to address, and the number of the most affected assets.

    If you choose to set your own goal, specify a desired value less than your current Cyber Risk Index in the text box. **Cyber Risk Exposure Management** starts to calculate the estimate after you apply the goal.

5.  Click **Apply**.

    The **Risk Reduction Measures** widget displays the risk events you need to address and provides recommended remediation actions that help you achieve a desired Cyber Risk Index. For details about the available actions that directly impact the Cyber Risk Index, see [Cyber Risk Index reduction](risk-index-reduction.mdx).

    :::note

    If you set your own goal, allow about 10 minutes for **Cyber Risk Exposure Management** to calculate and display the information.
