# Most critical failures

The Most critical failures section displays the top 15 failed [Checks](model-check.mdx) sorted by risk level against *All account,* *Individual accounts,* or *Groups*, and can be viewed either by *rule* or by *resource.* We recommend that you take [corrective actions](failed-check-resolution.mdx) on the most critical failures first as these failures potentially expose your organization to high-level security vulnerabilities, cost inefficiencies, performance, reliability, or other issues.
