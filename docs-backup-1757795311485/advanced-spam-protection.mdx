# Advanced Spam Protection

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection leverages **Content Scanning** to provide advanced spam protection, as a complement to the email protection service on your email gateway side, to further protect your email service users from graymail, scam, BEC, ransomware, advanced phishing, and other high-profile attacks. It uses the following components to implement heuristic policies when detecting unwanted content, or blocking, or automatically allowing an email message:

- Trend Micro Antispam Engine

- Trend Micro spam pattern files

Trend Micro updates both the engine and pattern files frequently and makes them available for download. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection automatically downloads these components through a scheduled update.

The Antispam engine uses spam signatures and heuristic rules to filter email messages. It scans email messages and assigns a spam score to each one based on how closely it matches the rules and patterns from the pattern file. It then compares the score to the user-defined spam detection level, and sends the result to Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection. When the spam score exceeds the detection level, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection takes action against the email message based on the category that the message falls into. You cannot modify the method that the Antispam engine uses to assign spam scores, but can adjust the detection levels used by Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to decide what is spam and what is not spam.

The antispam engine also leverages its Trend Micro Email Behaviour Analysis (EBA) module to detect graymail messages and scams:

- Graymail: Solicited bulk email messages that do not fit the definition of spam email messages. They could reasonably be considered either spam or good by different users.

- Scam: An attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence, for example, advance-fee schemes such as 419 scams, lottery scams, and bitcoin scams.

In addition, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection integrates with Trend Micro's Writing Style DNA as an additional layer of protection for your organization's users against BEC threats. For more information, see About writing style DNA.

## About writing style DNA {#about-writing-style-dna}

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection integrates with Trend Micro's Writing Style DNA as an additional layer of protection for your organization's users against BEC threats.

By leveraging writing style analysis that comes with Writing Style DNA, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection scans the written email messages of a desired individual to learn their particular writing style, and then trains a writing style model on the email system for authorship identification. This writing style model is a set of properties or features explored with automated methods that uniquely identify the way an individual composes email messages. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection then uses the model to compare with the incoming email messages claimed to be sent from the individual in protected mailboxes to identify the authorship.

:::note

In this release, writing style analysis applies to email messages written in English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Brazilian Portuguese.
:::

This requires Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to train and analyze the specific writing style model of each high profile user. As users' writing style models may change over time, it is also necessary to keep updating them to fine-tune email filtering. Therefore, once enabled with this feature, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection starts training writing styles of high profile users to build up usable personal models, and improves them once there are new written email messages.

## Configuring writing style analysis for BEC {#configuring-writing-style-analysis-for-bec}

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Select **Enable writing style analysis**.

    Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection automatically starts retrieving email messages written by high profile users from the configured email addresses and analyzing them to train the writing style model for each user. To view the training progress, go to **Global Settings → User-Defined Lists → High Profile Lists → High Profile Users**.

    To train the writing style model of each high profile user added for your email service, that is, Exchange Online or Gmail, you must enable writing style analysis in at least one Advanced Threat Protection policy for that service. If you disable writing style analysis in all policies of that service, the training process is paused and will be resumed when writing style analysis is enabled in at least one policy.

    :::warning[Important]

    Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection only scans email messages to train the particular writing style model for each high profile user, and does NOT collect any actual email message or its content.
    :::

2.  Select an action.

    An incoming email message that hits the writing style analysis criteria is subject to the action configured here, regardless of the setting for BEC in **Action**.

    For details about the actions, see [Actions available for different services](actions-different-services.mdx).

    If writing style analysis is enabled in more than one policy of an email service, the action configured in the policy with a higher priority applies.

    If you want an email address related to a high profile user to skip from scanning for writing style verification, add the email address in the **High Profile User Exception List**.

3.  Optionally select **Notify supposed sender** to decide whether to send a notification message to the high profile user who is expected to be the real sender of the email message.

    - Optionally select **Attach the original email message** to decide whether to add the original email message as an attachment when notifying the supposed sender.

      :::note

      This option does not apply when **Action** is set to **Delete** or **Quarantine**.
      :::

    - Optionally select **Allow the supposed sender to provide feedback** to decide whether to add a feedback option in the notification message.

      The supposed sender can click **Yes** or **No** to confirm whether the sender has actually sent the email message. This does not affect the configured action taken on the email message, but helps Trend Micro improve its writing style analysis capabilities.

4.  Optionally select **Notify administrator**.

    A message specifically designed for writing style analysis violation will be sent to notify the administrator that Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection detected a probable BEC attack through email and took action on the email message. Whether or not the administrator receives the notification message is subject to the settings here, regardless of the setting in **Notification**.

    - Optionally click **Edit notification** to modify the message content as necessary. For details about the tokens, see [Token list](token-list.mdx).

    - Optionally select **Attach the original email message** to decide whether to add the original email message as an attachment when notifying the administrator.

      :::note

      This option does not apply when **Action** is set to **Delete** or **Quarantine**.
      :::

## Advanced Spam Protection filtering action criteria {#advanced-spam-protection-filtering-action-criteria}

Advanced Spam Protection filtering action criteria for **Exchange Online** are described as follows:

- For the scam, BEC, phishing, ransomware, and malicious spam categories, the default action is **Quarantine**, that for graymail is **Pass**, and that for other spam is **Move to Junk Email folder**.

- After Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection takes the **Move to Junk Email folder** action against an email message, the email message will still be sent to other scanning filters for further processing.

- If an email message hits multiple categories, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection combines the actions set for each of these categories and takes only the action with the highest priority. The actions come with the following priorities from high to low: *Delete*, *Quarantine*, *Move to Junk Email folder*, *Tag subject*, *Pass*.

- If an email message is moved to or restored from the Junk Email folder by a user, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will scan and process the message when a new manual scan starts.

- If an email message is moved to the Junk Email folder by Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection after the **Move to Junk Email folder** action is taken, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will not scan and process the message again.

- If an email message is moved to the Junk Email folder by Exchange Online, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection processes it and still takes action against it as long as the action set for the corresponding spam category takes precedence over **Move to Junk Email folder**.

Advanced Spam Protection filtering action criteria for **Gmail** are described as follows:

- For the BEC, phishing, ransomware, and malicious spam categories, the default action is **Label email**, and that for other spam is **Move to Spam**.

- After Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection takes the **Move to Spam** action against an email message, the email message will still be sent to other scanning filters for further processing.

- If an email message hits multiple spam categories, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection combines the actions set for each of these categories and takes only the action with the highest priority. The actions come with the following priorities from high to low: *Delete*, *Label email*, *Move to Spam*, *Pass*.

- If an email message is moved to the Spam folder by Gmail, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection processes it and still takes action against it as long as the action set for the corresponding spam category takes precedence over **Move to Spam**.
