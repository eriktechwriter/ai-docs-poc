Apply a PAC file to the Secure Access Module in the Trend Vision One console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration**, and click the **PAC Files** tab.

2.  Decide the PAC file you want to use.

3.  Click ![](/images/apply_PAC_file=c95a7e15-901f-4293-aea0-a557e44d3145.webp) in the **Applied platform** column of the PAC file, and select to apply the PAC file to the Secure Access Module running the desired operating system.

    The PAC file replacement takes effect within a few minutes.

    You can also replace the PAC file in the Secure Access Module by individual endpoint or endpoint group in the **Secure Access Module** screen. For more information, see [PAC File replacement](pac-file-replacement.mdx).

    :::note

    For a single endpoint, the PAC file applied by individual endpoint or endpoint group takes effect, regardless of the platform-based PAC file configured for the endpoint.
