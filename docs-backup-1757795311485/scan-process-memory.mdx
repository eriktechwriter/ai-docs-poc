# Scan process memory (real-time scans only)

:::warning[Important]

Scan process memory does not support Linux and macOS agents.
:::

Monitor process memory in real time and perform additional checks with the Trend Micro Smart Protection network to determine whether a suspicious process is known to be malicious. If the process is malicious, Server & Workload Protection terminates the process. For more information, see [Smart Protection in Server & Workload Protection](smart-protection.mdx)

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Open the properties of the malware scan configuration.

2.  On the **General** tab, select **Scan process memory for malware**.

3.  Configure the settings for **Detection level** and **Prevention level**.

    :::warning[Important]

    - Adjusting Detection and Prevention levels only supports agent version version 20.0.1.25770 and later. Unsupported versions use the default level of **2 - Moderate** and cannot be changed.

    - Higher levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends selecting **2 - Moderate** for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints.

    - The **Prevention level** must be the same or lower than **Detection level**.

    - The **Action to take** selection might affect the prevention actions taken for the selected prevention level.
