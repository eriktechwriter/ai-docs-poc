# Create a log repository

Create a log repository to organize collected log data according to specified ingestion and retention settings.

### Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

To begin managing log data in a log repository, you must have one or more deployed Service Gateways with the [Third-Party Log Collection service installed](install-tplc-service.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration → Third-Party Log Collection** or **Service Management → Data Source and Log Management → Third-party log repositories**, click **Create New Log Repository**.

2.  Specify a name and description for the log repository.

3.  Select the desired ingestion and retention type.

    - Ingestion types

      - Analytic: Ingests log data for analysis, correlation, and threat hunting

        - Supports both analytic and archival retention

      - Archival: Ingests log data for infrequent queries or to meet compliance requirements

        - Only supports archival retention

      :::warning[Important]

      - To ingest log data, you must allocate credits to Agentic SIEM.

      - You cannot change the ingestion type for a log repository after you create the repository.
      :::

    - Retention types:

      - Analytic: Allows for frequent retrieval of log data for analysis, correlation, and threat hunting. Default retention period: 30 days

      - Archival: Stores data for compliance purposes or infrequent queries

      :::note

      Retention of data beyond the default period requires additional credits in Agentic SIEM.
      :::

4.  Click **Create**.

    The log repository is created and the log repository details drawer appears.

5.  [Add one or more collectors](create-collector.mdx) to the log repository to begin ingesting and retaining log data from your third-party data sources.

    :::warning[Important]

    Ensure you have installed the Third-Party Log Collection service on your deployed Service Gateways in Service Gateway Management before adding collectors.
    :::

6.  Monitor your data ingestion and retention in **Data Source and Log Management → Data usage and monitoring**.
