# Remove Endpoints

Remove endpoints from Endpoint Inventory.

:::warning[Important]

- Removing an endpoint does not uninstall the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent from the endpoint or stop the agent sending information to Trend Vision One. For information on how to uninstall the agent from the endpoint, see [Uninstalling Agents](uninstalling-agents.mdx).

- Endpoint Inventory cannot remove unmanaged endpoints. Unmanaged endpoints are endpoints which are discoverable in your security environment but not managed by Trend Vision One or a connected Trend Micro endpoint protection product.

  To filter for unmanaged endpoints, click **Unmanaged endpoints** under **Available Actions** in Endpoint Inventory.

  To manage security on unmanaged endpoints, [deploy a Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent](deploy-agents.mdx).

- Endpoint Inventory cannot remove endpoints managed by connected endpoint protection products, such as Trend Cloud One or Trend Micro Apex One. Access the management console to remove agents managed by connected endpoint protection products.

  To filter for connected endpoint protection products, click **Connected Endpoint Protection** under **Security Deployment** in Endpoint Inventory.
