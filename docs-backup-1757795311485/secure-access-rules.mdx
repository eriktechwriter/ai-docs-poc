# Secure access rules

The **Secure Access Rules** screen provides you an overview of the secure access rules that you have created to mitigate different risks across your network environment.

Before creating a secure access rule, grant the following permissions or complete the following configurations:

- Configure your IAM related settings to allow Trend Vision One to access user data, authenticate users, and take access control actions on your IAM system. For more information, see [Supported IAM systems and required permissions](iam-systems-required-permissions.mdx).

- Deploy the private access service to secure access to your organization's internal apps. For more information, see [Private Access configuration](private-access-configuration.mdx).

- Deploy the internet access service to protect your users against risks and threats when they visit cloud apps and external URLs. For more information, see [Internet Access and AI Service Access configuration](internet-access-configuration.mdx).

The rules enable you to respond to risky behavior or suspicious entities and activities in your environment, so that you can perform dynamic control over access to internal and cloud applications by risk, identity, time, and location.</p>
