# Configuring a domain

After adding a domain, perform required configurations to finish provisioning the domain. On the **Domains** screen, any domain missing required configurations is in the "Configuration required" status, and a red exclamation mark will be shown next to the field that requires your operation or reports any problem. You can hover over the exclamation mark to view the detailed error message.

After you finish all required operations, the status of the domain will change from "Configuration required" into "Completed."

:::note

- If the same domain already exists under **Administration â†’ Domain Verification** in the Trend Vision One console, its verification status there will also change to verified.

- In addition to verifying a domain on the **Domains** screen, you can verify it under **Domain Verification** in the Trend Vision One console. After successful verification, the domain's status on this screen will automatically change to "Completed."
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **General** section, verify your domain.

    1.  Add the TXT record provided on the console to your domain's DNS configuration to prove that you own the domain.

    2.  Click **Verify**.

        The message "Domain verified" appears if the domain verification is successful.

    If your domain does not pass verification, the built-in policy rule "Global Anti-Virus Rule (Enforced on Unverified Domains)" will be forcibly applied to incoming messages sent to the domain.

    If you have difficulty adding the TXT record, you can add an MX record for your domain instead:

    Add an MX record for the Cloud Email Gateway Protection server with the highest preference value.

    - North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific:

      `<your_domain> MX preference = 20, mail exchanger = <your_domain_mta>`

      `<your_domain> MX preference = ``32767``, mail exchanger = ``<company_identifier>.in.tmes.trendmicro.com`

    - Europe and Africa:

      `<your_domain> MX preference = 20, mail exchanger = <your_domain_mta>`

      `<your_domain> MX preference = ``32767``, mail exchanger = ``<company_identifier>.in.tmes.trendmicro.eu`

    - Australia and New Zealand:

      `<your_domain> MX preference = 20, mail exchanger = <your_domain_mta>`

      `<your_domain> MX preference = ``32767``, mail exchanger = ``<company_identifier>.in.tmes-anz.trendmicro.com`

    - Japan:

      `<your_domain> MX preference = 20, mail exchanger = <your_domain_mta>`

      `<your_domain> MX preference = ``32767``, mail exchanger = ``<company_identifier>.in.tmems-jp.trendmicro.com`

    - Singapore:

      `<your_domain> MX preference = 20, mail exchanger = <your_domain_mta>`

      `<your_domain> MX preference = ``32767``, mail exchanger = ``<company_identifier>.in.tmes-sg.trendmicro.com`

    - India:

      `<your_domain> MX preference = 20, mail exchanger =<your_domain_mta>`

      `<your_domain> MX preference = ``32767``, mail exchanger =``<company_identifier>.in.tmes-in.trendmicro.com`

    - Middle East (UAE):

      `<your_domain> MX preference = 20, mail exchanger =<your_domain_mta>`

      `<your_domain> MX preference = ``32767``, mail exchanger =``<company_identifier>.in.tmes-uae.trendmicro.com`

    :::note

    In the preceding MX record, the second preference value `32767` is only used as an example. When setting the second preference value, make sure it is larger than the first preference value, which means this route has lower priority than the first one.

    To learn more about MX records, see [About mx records and Cloud Email Gateway Protection](mx-records.mdx).

    :::tip

    DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours. The status of the domain you are adding does not change until DNS propagation is complete. During this period, do not turn off any on-premises security. While waiting for DNS propagation, you can use the administrator console to customize the domain settings for features such as **Policy**, **Recipient Filter**, **Sender Filter**, **Policy Objects**, **BEC**, and **IP Reputation**.

    If the domain stays as unverified for more than 48 hours, confirm that the TXT record or MX record for the domain is correct.

    - For Linux, run one of the following commands:

      `dig txt`` <domain_name>`

      `dig mx`` <domain_name>`

    - For Windows, run one of the following commands:

      `nslookup -q=txt`` <domain_name>`

      `nslookup -q=mx`` <domain_name>`

2.  In the **Inbound Servers** section, complete the following configurations:
