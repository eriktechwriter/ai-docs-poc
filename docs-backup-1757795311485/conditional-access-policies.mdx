# Access Policy

View conditional access (CA) policies used by your organization, including status and the identities to which the policies are assigned.

The **Access Policy** tab allows you to view the CA policies used in your organization and applied to registered identities. CA policies are if-then statements in which an assigned identity meets one or more conditions, such as enabling multi-factor authentication, in order to trigger an action, such as allowing full access to an application or network.

The following table details the columns on the **Access Policy** tab.
