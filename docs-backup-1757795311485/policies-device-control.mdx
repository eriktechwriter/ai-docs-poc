Device Control regulates access to external storage devices connected to computers. Device Control helps prevent data leaks and, combined with file scanning, helps guard against security risks.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To protect your endpoints with Device Control, select **Enable**.

2.  To manage what actions to take for connected devices, configure the **Permission by device type**.

    1.  To control access to USB storage devices, select permissions for **USB storage devices**.

        - **Allow full access**: Allow endpoint users full access to any connected USB storage device.

        - **Read only access**: Allow endpoint users to only view the contents of connected USB storage devices.

        - **Block access**: Deny endpoint users access to connected USB storage devices.

    2.  To control the AutoRun function, select permissions for **USB AutoRun function**.

        :::note

        If **USB storage devices** is set to **Block access**, then **USB AutoRun function** is automatically set to **Block AutoRun** and disabled.
        :::

        - **Allow AutoRun**: Allows any AutoRun function on the USB storage device to execute.

        - **Block AutoRun**: Blocks AutoRun funcitons from executing.

    3.  To control access to connected mobile devices, select permissions for **Mobile devices**

        - **Allow full access**: Allow endpoint users full access to any connected mobile device.

        - **Read only access**: Allow endpoint users to only view the contents of connected mobile devices.

        - **Block access**: Deny endpoint users access to connected mobile devices.

3.  To specify trusted devices, manage the **Allowed devices**.

    :::note

    To extract the device information for use with the Allowed devices list, use the [Trend Micro Device Info tool](https://success.trendmicro.com/en-US/solution/KA-0011756).

    To create a sample device list, add one device manually, then export the list.
    :::

    1.  To add a device manually, click **Add device**.

    2.  In the **Allowed device** window, specify a unique **Name**.

    3.  Copy and paste the **Vendor**, **Model**, and **Serial number** extracted using the [Trend Micro Device Info tool](https://success.trendmicro.com/en-US/solution/KA-0011756).

    4.  Click **Add device**.

    5.  To export the current device list as an XML file, click **Export**.

    6.  To import a device list from an XML file, click **Import from file** and select the file you want to use.

        :::warning[Important]

        The file must not exceed 500 devices.

        Importing a device list from a file overwrites the current device list.
