  For example:

  - A local MTA or mail server

  - A cloud-based MTA solution

- Access to domain MX records (DNS mail exchanger host records) for repointing MX records to the Cloud Email Gateway Protection MTA

  (Contact your service provider, if necessary, for more information or configuration help.)
