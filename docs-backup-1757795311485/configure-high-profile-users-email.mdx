# Configuring high profile users

Specify the email display names of the high profile users who might be frequently forged. Cloud Email Gateway Protection will check incoming email messages claimed to be sent from those users and apply fraud checking criteria to identify forged messages. Cloud Email Gateway Protection enables you to take actions on the BEC attacks that are detected or suspected by the Antispam Engine or detected by writing style analysis.

The specified high profile users are applicable to all BEC policies of your domains as the global settings.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Inbound Protection → Spam Filtering → High Profile Users**.

2.  From the **Source** drop-down list, select either of the following:

    - **Synchronize users from Directory**: select this option to synchronize users from your directory.

      - Click **Select Groups** to select a user group that you want to synchronize.

        A maximum of 500 users can be synchronized from one or multiple directory groups. If there are more than 500 users, Cloud Email Gateway Protection sorts all users alphanumerically in ascending order and applies BEC policies only to the first 500 users.

        :::note

        The Directory Synchronization Tool is required to synchronize user information from the directory server. For details about installing and updating the tool, see the [Directory Synchronization Tool User's Guide](https://docs.trendmicro.com/all/ent/tmems/vAll/en-us/Directory%20Synchronization%20Tool%20Users%20Guide.pdf). To download the tool and the guide, do the following:

        1.  Go to **Administration → Other Settings → Directory Management**.

        2.  On the **Directory Synchronize** tab, find the tool and guide under **Downloads**.

        If you select **Microsoft AD Global Catalog** for synchronization in the Directory Synchronization Tool, make sure the `givenName`, `initials` and `sn` attributes have been replicated. By default, these attributes are not replicated to the global catalog server by Microsoft. If they are not replicated, use the Active Directory Schema snap-in in the Microsoft Management Console for replication.
