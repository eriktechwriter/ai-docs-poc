# Exposure Overview

::::Learn about the information available in Exposure Overview within Cyber Risk Overview.

**Exposure Overview** displays your company's average exposure risk level and corresponding risk score for the category over the last 30 days. The exposure score is calculated using the weight of each exposure-related risk factor and the corresponding risk events in your environment along with the potential impact if the detected issues are exploited. Time-critical vulnerabilities are given greater weight in the calculation.

:::warning[Important]

The exposure risk level is calculated using all data received from your business without applying asset visibility scope limits.
:::

For customers with [Vulnerability Assessment](vulnerability-assessment.mdx) enabled, the **Vulnerabilities** tab in **Exposure Overview** displays:

- **Time-critical security alerts**: Alerts related to detected vulnerabilities on Windows or Linux devices that might indicate an ongoing zero-day attack, or high-profile N-day vulnerabilities that Trend Micro recommends you address immediately to bolster your security posture. The primary criteria for issuing a time-critical security alert include the potential impact, whether the vulnerability is highly likely to be exploited, and whether exploit code is publicly available. Zero-day or high-profile vulnerabilities are detected in part using Advanced Risk Telemetry enabled on your endpoints.

  To learn more about a highlighted vulnerability, including affected operating systems, available attack prevention/detection rules, and recommended mitigation or remediation options, click **View details** in the security alert. Trend Micro only issues time-critical security alerts for vulnerabilities with available mitigation options. You may create a new case for the vulnerability or add the vulnerability to an existing case by clicking the options icon (![](/images/options=ddb0b67f-0654-4aa5-8bc7-48ec554c5448.webp)) in the vulnerability entry.

  :::warning[Important]

  Not all remediation or mitigation options are available for all supported operating systems. If automatic mitigation detection is unavailable, mitigated devices may still remain on the affected devices list after mitigation is complete.
  :::

  For high-profile N-day vulnerabilities, you can view a summary including:

  - The number of assessed devices in your environment

  - How many assessed devices are affected by the vulnerability

  - How many endpoints have been the target of exploit attempts related to the vulnerability

- **Vulnerabilities widgets**: Widgets displaying metrics about your current exposure risk and vulnerability management status as they relate to different asset types in your organization. Vulnerability widgets are available for the following supported asset types:

  - Internal assets

  - Internet-facing assets

  - Containers

  - Cloud VMs

  - Serverless functions

The following tables detail the vulnerabilities widgets available on the tab corresponding to each asset type.
