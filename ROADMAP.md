## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### **Standalone Value at Each Phase**
- Each phase delivers complete, usable functionality
- No phase depends on future phases for basic operation
- Clear rollback points if issues arise

### **Progressive Complexity**
- Start with proven technologies (MDX, Docusaurus, GitHub)
- Add AI capabilities incrementally
- Build confidence and expertise gradually

### **Clear Success Metrics**
- Measurable outcomes at each phase
- Regular stakeholder check-ins and demos
- Continuous validation of approach and value

---

## Resource Requirements

### **Phase 1**: Minimal - mostly configuration and setup
### **Phase 2**: Moderate - AI integration and tool development
### **Phase 3**: Moderate - Content generation system development
### **Phase 4**: Light - Demo development and presentation preparation

---

## Next Steps

### **Immediate (Phase 1 Completion)**
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
2. Configure password-protected hosting
3. Finalize VS Code + GitHub integration
4. Complete any remaining content cleanup

### **Upcoming (Phase 2 Planning)**
1. Gather resources for automated metadata creation
2. Design quality scoring system
3. Research VS Code AI integration options
4. Plan content optimization strategy
