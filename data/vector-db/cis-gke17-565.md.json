Disable public IP addresses for cluster nodes, so that they only have private IP addresses. Disabling public IP addresses on cluster nodes restricts access to only internal networks, forcing attackers to obtain local network access before attempting to compromise the underlying Kubernetes hosts. Note By default, Private Nodes are disabled. Impact To enable Private Nodes, the cluster has to also be configured with a private master IP range and IP Aliasing enabled. Private Nodes do not have outbound access to the public internet. If you want to provide outbound Internet access for your private nodes, you can use Cloud NAT or you can manage your own NAT gateway.",

Audit Using Google Cloud Console: Go to Kubernetes Engine website. Select the desired cluster, and within the Details pane, make sure Private Clusters is set to Enabled. Using Command Line: Run this command: gcloud container clusters describe <cluster_name> --format json | jq '.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes' The output of the above command returns true if Private Nodes is enabled. Remediation Once a cluster is created without enabling Private Nodes, it cannot be remediated. Rather the cluster must be recreated. Using Google Cloud Console: Go to Kubernetes Engine website. Click CREATE CLUSTER. Configure the cluster as required then click Networking under CLUSTER in the navigation pane. Under IPv4 network access, click the Private cluster radio button. Configure the other settings as required, and click CREATE.",
