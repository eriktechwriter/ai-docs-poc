This method used an AWS CloudFormation template to add your account. All of the AWS instances associated with your account would appear on the Computer page, listed under your AWS account name and regions. Server & Workload Protection includes the ability to display your AWS instances organized by region, VPC and subnet. The migration from the older type of AWS connection to the new method usually happens automatically. However, if Server & Workload Protection encounters a problem and cannot perform the migration automatically, it will produce an \"AWS Account Migration Failed\" alert. If you encounter this alert, follow the steps in this article to migrate your AWS account connection.",
