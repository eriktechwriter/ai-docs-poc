Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection allows you to set up approved email header field lists in policies and in administrative settings for different purposes. If you want certain email messages to skip scanning by all policies, for example, to do a phishing simulation campaign via email, you can create a global approved list so messages that match the header field criteria will not be scanned by all enabled Advanced Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention policies for Exchange Online and will be delivered to the intended recipients.",
