Note The availability of certain report templates and data sources depends on your license entitlement for the associated app or service. For more information, see Reports license requirements. Procedure Go to Dashboards and Reports → Reports. To configure a new report, go to the Report Templates tab and click the template you want to use. To edit a scheduled report, go to the Scheduled Report Settings tab and click the name of the report you want to edit. Configure the General Settings. Specify a Name to identify the report.",
