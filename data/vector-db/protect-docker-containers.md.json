Like any well-designed software deployment, OS hardening and the use of best practices for your deployment, such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark, provide a solid foundation as a starting point. Once you have a secure foundation in place, adding Server & Workload Protection to your deployment gives you access to Trend Micro’s extensive experience protecting physical, virtual, and cloud workloads as well as to real-time threat information from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network. Server & Workload Protection both protects your deployment as well as helps meet and maintain continuous compliance requirements. See Docker support for information on supported Docker editions and releases.",
