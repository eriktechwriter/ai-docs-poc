The Workbench Insight Progression Update playbook helps security teams streamline communication and accelerate response by automatically notifying stakeholders when Workbench insights are generated or updated. This playbook can open or update a case for the insight and send email notifications of insight information to specified recipients. Notifications and case updates can include a Generative AI-generated summary of the insight, providing clear and contextual information to support informed decision-making. You can configure the playbook to target specific insights based on score, attack phase, alert severity, or case status.",
