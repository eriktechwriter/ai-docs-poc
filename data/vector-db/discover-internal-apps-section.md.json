Application discovery helps to ascertain the applications that were not explicitly named that users might have been using over the past 14 days. This feature also identifies users who have accessed the applications and recommends the most likely user groups. You can enforce granular access rules on these applications or even restrict the access. Zero Trust Secure Access only discovers an application when a user requests access to it, but does not constantly scan the network traffic for new applications. Procedure On the Internal Applications tab, click Discover Internal Applications. Click Add Application for Discovery. The Add Application screen appears. Configure an application for discovery.",
