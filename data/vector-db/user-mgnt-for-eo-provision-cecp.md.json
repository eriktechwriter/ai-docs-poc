Previously, this option did not support user synchronization, making user updates impossible after access was granted. The enhanced user management feature lets administrators review synchronized users and make necessary adjustments, providing greater control and flexibility. This ensures that new users receive Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection protection and allows easier removal of unavailable users.
