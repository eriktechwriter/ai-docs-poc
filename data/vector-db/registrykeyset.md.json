The HKCU branch of the registry is only valid for an interactive logged-on user, and it is specific to that user. In a Windows terminal server environment or on Windows XP and Vista with \"fast user switching\" enabled, several different users could be logged on simultaneously. Because of this, the agent will say that any rule with HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a compile error. There are several subkeys under HKEY_USERS that are named using the numeric form of the Windows user account ID. When a user logs on, one of those subkeys is mapped to HKCU during the user's logon session. Tip Rules are allowed to use HKEY_USERS in their base to monitor per-user registry items.",
