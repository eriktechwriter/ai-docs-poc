Scheduled tasks are useful when deploying Server & Workload Protection in your environment and also later, to keep your system up to date and functioning smoothly. They are especially useful for running scans on a regular basis during off-peak hours. Workload Security performs some tasks (for example, backup and checking for software updates) automatically. You can automate scheduled task creation and configuration using the Server & Workload Protection application programming interface (API). For examples, see the Maintain Protection Using Scheduled Tasks.",

When a scheduled scan reaches the timeout limit, any running or pending tasks are canceled. If a task times out, the next scheduled scan starts over from the beginning; it does not start where the previous scan ended. The goal is to perform a complete scan, so consider making configuration changes if your scans regularly reach the timeout limit. For example, you could add exceptions or extend the timeout period for the scan. Scan Computers for Recommendations scans the computers for common applications and makes recommendations based on what the scan detects. Regular recommendation scans ensure that the latest, relevant rule sets protect your computers and remove rules that are no longer required.",

Classic recommendation scan can be resource-intensive, so agents that meet the requirements use the enhanced recommendation scan. For agents that do not meet the requirements, scan by group (for example, per policy or for a group of less than 1,000 computers) and spread it over different days (for example, database server scans on Mondays and mail server scans on Tuesdays) to minimize the effect on your system.
