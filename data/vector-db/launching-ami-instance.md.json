If your security environment uses a hybrid deployment, or you do not have VMware or Microsoft Hyper-V in your environment, you can leverage your Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts to deploy a Virtual Network Sensor using Amazon Machine Images (AMI). Note The steps contained in these instructions are valid as of January 2024. Before you begin, make sure you have completed the following tasks: Choose or create a VPC for the Virtual Network Sensor instance. Choose or create the subnets for the Virtual Network Sensor data port and management port. Trend Micro recommends using different subnets for the data and management ports. For more information on how to set up a VPC and subnet, refer to the Amazon documentation.",
