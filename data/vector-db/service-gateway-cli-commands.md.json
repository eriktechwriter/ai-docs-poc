To access the CLI, connect to VMware ESXi (either directly or through SSH) and open the Service Gateway virtual appliance. Log on to the CLI with your account credentials. For customers using the previous Service Gateway 1.0 version, check the Service Gateway 1.0 CLI commands. Note Make sure you disable the Scroll Lock key on your keyboard when using HyperTerminal. To view basic information of the Service Gateway, such as network settings and service status, run the show command. For example, use show ipv4 address to check the network address. For a list of available commands, type show and then press the ? key. To view a list of tasks you can perform and enable administrative commands, run the enable command. Enabling administrative commands changes the command prompt from > to #.",
