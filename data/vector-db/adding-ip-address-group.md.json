Procedure On the Secure Access Resources screen, click the IP Address Groups tab and then click Add. The IP Address Group Settings screen appears. Select the type of IP addresses you want to add. A private IP address group references a set of IP addresses or segments on the internal corporate network that share the same egress IP address. You can define a private IP address group to identify a sub-location within a corporate network location. You can then use these sub-locations to implement different internet access rules for the corporate network location, regardless of which users are accessing from these internal IP addresses.",
