Sandbox images allow observation of file and URL behavior in an environment that simulates endpoints on your network without any risk of compromising the network. Virtual Analyzer works in conjunction with Threat Connect, the Trend Micro global intelligence network that provides actionable information and recommendations for dealing with threats. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection sends suspicious files (including email attachments and uploaded files) and URLs (included in files and email message bodies) to Virtual Analyzer when a file or URL exhibits suspicious characteristics and signature-based scanning technologies cannot find a known threat. Virtual Analyzer performs static analysis and behavior simulation in various runtime environments to identify potentially malicious characteristics.",
