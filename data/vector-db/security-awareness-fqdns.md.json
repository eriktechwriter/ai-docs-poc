Your network firewalls may block FQDNs used to access and deliver training campaign and phishing simulation content. Add the following regional URLs to your firewall exceptions to ensure access to Security Awareness content. Important Training programs used in training campaigns may use domains that are not included on the list of firewall exceptions. Training programs are created by third-party content providers and may use different domains depending on the content selected. Check whether your firewall blocks domains related to the provider of the selected third-party content if you have issues accessing training program content.",
