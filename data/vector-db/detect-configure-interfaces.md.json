If a policy with multiple interface assignments has been assigned to the computer, interfaces that match the patterns defined in the policy will be identified. The Interface Types section of the Policy editor provides additional capabilities: Configure a policy for multiple interfaces If you have computers with more than one interface, you can assign various elements of a policy (firewall rules, etc.) to each interface. Procedure In the Policy editor, click Interface Types. In the Network Interface Specificity section, select Rules can apply to specific interfaces In the Interface Type sections that appear, type the names and pattern matching strings.",

    "content": "Next steps The interface type name is used only for reference. Common names include \"LAN\", \"WAN\", \"DMZ\", and \"Wi-Fi\", though any name can be used to map to your network's topology. The interface name used for all container network interfaces and host virtual interfaces is \"integrated_veth\", which has a MAC address of 02:00:00:00:00:00. The matches define a wildcard-based interface name to auto map the interfaces to the appropriate interface type. Examples would be \"Local Area Connection *\", \"eth*\", or \"Wireless *\". When an interface cannot be mapped automatically, an alert is triggered. You can manually map it from the Interfaces page in the computer editor for a particular computer. Note If Server & Workload Protection detects interfaces on the computer that don't match any of these entries, it will trigger an alert. Enforce interface isolation When Interface Isolation is enabled, the firewall will try to match the regular expression patterns to interface names on the local computer.",

WARNING Before you enable Interface Isolation, make sure that you have configured the interface patterns in the proper order and that you have removed or added all necessary string patterns. Only interfaces matching the highest priority pattern will be permitted to transmit traffic. Other interfaces (which match any of the remaining patterns on the list) will be \"restricted\".
