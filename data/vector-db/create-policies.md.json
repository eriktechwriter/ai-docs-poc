You can use the Policy editor to create and edit policies that you can then apply to one or more computers. You can also use the Computer editor (which is very similar to the Policy editor) to apply settings to a specific computer, but the recommended method is to create specialized policies rather then edit the settings in the Computer editor. Tip You can automate policy creation and configuration using the Server & Workload Protection API. For examples, see Create and Configure Policies. Create a new policy Procedure Click Policies → New → New Policy. Enter a name for the policy. If you want the new policy to inherit its settings from an existing policy, select a policy from the Inherit from list and click Next.",

Note When importing policies, ensure that the system where you created the policies and the system that will receive them both have the latest security updates. If the system that is receiving the policies is running an older security update, it may not have some of the rules referenced in the policies from the up-to-date system.
