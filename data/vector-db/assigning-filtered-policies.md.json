Trend Micro Apex Central assigns the new endpoint to a filtered policy when the following conditions are both satisfied: The new endpoint matches the target criteria in the policy The policy creator has the permission to manage the new endpoint The same action applies to an endpoint already assigned to a policy, but the policy creator later deletes the policy. Note For endpoints just registered to Trend Micro Apex Central and for those just released from deleted policies, there is a three-minute grace period during which no endpoint allocation occurs. These endpoints are temporarily without policies during this period.",

This action occurs once at 3:15 pm every day. When endpoint properties change, such as the operating system or IP address, these endpoints require the daily schedule to re-assign them to the correct policies. Note If the endpoints are offline during the daily endpoint allocation schedule, the policy status for these endpoints will remain pending until they go online. If the Apex One domain of the endpoint is changed, Trend Micro Apex Central deploys the updated the policy after 10 minutes.",
