You can still use APIs to add new accounts to Server & Workload Protection. However, Trend Micro recommends using the Cloud Accounts app, which provides access to more advanced cloud security and XDR capabilities. This topic is for reference only. You can set up automatic protection in Server & Workload Protection for new instances created by AWS Auto Scaling. Each instance created by Auto Scaling will need to have an agent installed on it. There are two ways that you can do this: you can include a pre-installed agent in the EC2 instance used to create the AMI, or you install the agent by including a deployment script in the launch configuration for the AMI.",

    "content": "There are pros and cons for each option: If you include a pre-installed agent, instances will spin up more quickly because there is no need to download and install the agent software. The downside is that the agent software might not be the latest. To work around this issue, you can enable the upgrade on activation feature. If you use a deployment script to install the agent, it will always get the latest version of the agent software from Server & Workload Protection. Pre-install the agent If you have an EC2 instance already configured with an agent, you can use that instance to create the AMI for Auto Scaling. Before creating the AMI, you must deactivate the agent on the EC2 instance and stop the instance: dsa_control -rEach new EC2 instance created by Auto Scaling needs to have its agent activated and a policy applied to it, if it doesn’t have one already. There are two ways to do this: You can create a deployment script that activates the agent and optionally applies a policy.",
