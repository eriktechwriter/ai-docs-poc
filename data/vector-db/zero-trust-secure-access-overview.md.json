    "content": "Zero Trust Secure Access manages user risk and controls access to resources using the following kinds of rules: Private access rules control access to private or internal apps, including private cloud apps. Enforce private access rules with connector virtual appliances associated with each private app. Internet access rules control access to the internet, such as blocking certain kinds of risky sites or public cloud apps. Enforce internet access rules with an Internet Access Gateway. Risk control rules control user accounts and devices based on risk scores and other behavior. Risk control rules can also block private or internet access for individual users under preset conditions. A secure access module is installed on each device to enforce the rules, and secure access should be permitted by existing firewalls. Alternatively, PAC files and local gateways can facilitate access to network resources for devices that cannot install the secure access module.",
