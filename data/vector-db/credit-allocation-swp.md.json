Once a license entitlement is converted into credits, the credits are automatically added to your overall credit balance. Trend Vision One automatically allocates credits based on the Endpoint Security features that you enable. Credits can be allocated to the following Trend Vision One Endpoint Security offerings: Endpoint sensor detection and response: 20 credits required per deployment Advanced Endpoint Security: 45 credits required per deployment Advanced Server & Workload Protection: 235 credits required per deployment For example, if you enable Advanced Server & Workload Protection for two deployments, 470 credits (2 deployments x 235 credits) are allocated to the offering from your overall balance.",

Credits are allocated towards different Endpoint Security offerings depending on which modules you use. Certain modules are exclusive to Advanced Server & Workload Protection deployments, meaning that their use requires 235 credits per deployment. If you only want to allocate credits towards Endpoint sensor detection and response or Advanced Endpoint Security deployments, avoid using the following modules: Intrusion Prevention (Server applications) Integrity Monitoring Log Inspection Container Protection Server & Workload Protection supports running recommendation scans on the Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection modules. Enabling recommendation scans causes Trend Vision One to allocate credits to both Advanced Endpoint Security (45 credits) and Advanced Server & Workload Protection (235 credits), for a total of 280 credits per deployment.",
