Trend Vision One provides a set of pre-defined rule templates that correlate to different types of information you want to gather about your network environment. You can create a risk control rule from a template, fine-tune the rule to achieve expected results, and add automated actions to respond to and remediate risks automatically. The following table describes the Risk Control rule templates. Template Name Description Target Users with a persistent high risk score A user has maintained a high risk score range over a period of time in the past User risk score: Risk score range that the user has maintained For more information about a user's risk score, see Asset profile screens.",
