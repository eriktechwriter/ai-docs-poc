Security Configuration Overview displays your risk level and risk score within the security configuration risk category. The risk level is a comprehensive rating of your organization's protection product status and is based on the deployment and status of protection products within your endpoint, email, and network security layers plus adoption rates for key product features or risk events based on product configurations. An overall high security configuration risk level or a high risk level within a specific security layer indicates that you may need to review the status of deployed products and optimize product security features and configurations.",

For the endpoint security layer, you can switch data sources using the dropdown menu. Trend Vision One Endpoint Security is the default data source.
