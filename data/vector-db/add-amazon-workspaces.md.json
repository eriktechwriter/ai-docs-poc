You can still use APIs to add new accounts to Server & Workload Protection. However, Trend Micro recommends using the Cloud Accounts app, which provides access to more advanced cloud security and XDR capabilities. This topic is for reference only. Amazon WorkSpaces are virtual cloud desktops that run in Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can protect them with Server & Workload Protection following the instructions below. Note The agent only supports Amazon WorkSpaces Windows desktops — it does not support Linux desktops.",
