Attack Path Prediction is a proactive approach to evaluating potential attack scenarios across discovered assets in your organization. Using real-time insights from an attacker’s perspective, you can better understand how threat actors might reach your critical assets and mitigate risks before the risks are exploited. Attack Path Prediction analyzes issues detected in your organization's security posture, including: Vulnerabilities Misconfigurations Threat detections Security controls Internet exposure Analysis is performed using Cyber Risk Exposure Management core features, including: Asset discovery, profiling, and criticality identification Automatically identify assets in your environment Assess asset criticality and i",

Attack Path Prediction analyzes your assets and security posture daily. Displayed information is based on data collected over the last 30 days. Data for analysis comes from connected Trend Micro products and third-party data sources. For more comprehensive attack path analysis, connect more data sources. When Attack Path Prediction identifies a potential attack path, an attack path risk event is generated in addition to the risk events detected on the associated assets. Multiple attack paths may share the same entry point, resulting in multiple attack path risk events. Attack path risk events affect your Cyber Risk Index. Trend Micro recommends eliminating entry point and attack path events through remediation to prevent abuse by attackers. Attack Path Prediction displays the following information for each potential attack path identified.",

Riskier entry points and nodes along the attack path result in a higher likelihood of exploitation. Impact: The impact that exploitation of the attack path could have on your organization, determined by the asset criticality of associated assets. Only the highest score within each attack path group is displayed. Entry point and target point At-risk assets at the beginning and end of an attack path. Attack paths may only contain a single asset as both the entry and target point if the asset is highly critical and has a high risk score. Entry point risk events The number of risk events on the entry point that could facilitate the attack path.
