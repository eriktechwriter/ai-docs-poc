Release Channels signal a graduating level of stability and production-readiness. These are based on observed performance of GKE clusters running that version and represent experience and confidence in the cluster version. The Regular release channel upgrades every few weeks and is for production users who need features not yet offered in the Stable channel. These versions have passed internal validation, but don't have enough historical data to guarantee their stability. Known issues generally have known workarounds.",

These versions have passed internal validation and have been shown to be stable and reliable in production, based on the observed performance of those clusters. Critical security patches are delivered to all release channels. Note Currently, release channels are not enabled by default. Impact Once release channels are enabled on a cluster, they cannot be disabled. To stop using release channels, the cluster must be recreated without the --release-channel flag. Node auto-upgrade is enabled (and cannot be disabled), so the cluster is updated automatically from releases available in the chosen release channel.
