Strong passwords are long, complex, uncommon, and never reused. Your organization's password creation policy ideally requires a minimum length and a certain level of complexity (combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols). You may also prohibit usage of common and previously used passwords. The strong password requirement is enabled by default in Microsoft 365. Disabling the requirement makes user accounts more susceptible to brute force attacks, wherein threat actors use trial and error to guess account credentials, particularly passwords. Threat actors cycle through combinations of characters, commonly used passwords, and compromised credentials to sign into accounts.",
