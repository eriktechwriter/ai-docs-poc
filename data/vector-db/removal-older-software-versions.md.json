We only remove software when there is a significant known issue with that release. This is done to limit customer exposure to known problems. When access to an old software version has been removed, the download link is replaced with a link to a Knowledge Base article detailing the issue that caused us to remove the software. If you require access to an older version that has been removed, contact support with the software version and Knowledge Base number. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
