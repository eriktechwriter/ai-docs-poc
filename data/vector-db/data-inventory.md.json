The Data Inventory list updates automatically when data policies are created or updated, and when assets are added or removed to the network locations specified in the data policies. Note You must enable the Endpoint sensor detection and response setting in Endpoint Security to send activity data for state-of-the-art threat detections and alerts (required for advanced XDR detections and Workbench alerts). This setting requires credits to enable. For more information, see Configure endpoint security policies.",
