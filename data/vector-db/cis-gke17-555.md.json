Shielded GKE nodes protects clusters against boot- or kernel-level malware or rootkits which persist beyond infected OS. Shielded GKE nodes run firmware which is signed and verified using Google's Certificate Authority, ensuring that the nodes' firmware is unmodified and establishing the root of trust for Secure Boot. GKE node identity is strongly protected via virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) and verified remotely by the master node before the node joins the cluster. Lastly, GKE node integrity (i.e., boot sequence and kernel) is measured and can be monitored and verified remotely.",

Impact After Shielded GKE Nodes is enabled in a cluster, any nodes created in a Node pool without Shielded GKE Nodes enabled, or created outside of any Node pool, aren't able to join the cluster. Shielded GKE Nodes can only be used with Container-Optimized OS (COS), COS with containerd, and Ubuntu node images. Audit Using Google Cloud Console: Go to Kubernetes Engine website. Select the cluster under test from the list of clusters. Ensure that Shielded GKE Nodes are Enabled under the Details pane. Using Command Line: Run the following command: gcloud container clusters describe <cluster_name> --format json | jq '.shieldedNodes' This will return the following if Shielded GKE Nodes are enabled: { \"enabled\": true } Remediation Note From version 1.18, clusters will have Shielded GKE nodes enabled by default.",
