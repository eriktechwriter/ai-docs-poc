For example, assign a policy to a computer that was just added to Server & Workload Protection, or that was discovered to have no policy assigned. To assign a policy, you use the Modify a Computer operation. Before you begin You should have already verified that your environment is set up to use the API using Bash or PowerShell. Gather the following information that you need to complete this recipe: The URL of Server & Workload Protection The secret key for your API key The ID of the computer to which you are assigning the policy The ID of the policy to assign If you don't know the ID of the policy or the computer, you can use the Search for a Policy and Get a List of Computers recipes to obtain them.",
