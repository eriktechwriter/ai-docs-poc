These products synchronize and use all or some of these objects. Apex Central can also send suspicious IP addresses and domains to TippingPoint. Note The Distribution Settings also allows you to configure Suspicious Object Hub and Node Apex Central server settings to synchronize suspicious object lists across multiple Apex Central servers. For more information, see Suspicious Object Hub and Node Architecture. Procedure Go to Threat Intel → Distribution Settings. The Distribution Settings screen appears. To send suspicious objects to managed products: Click the Managed Products tab. Select the Send suspicious objects to managed products check box.",
