The internet access and AI service access service safeguards your users' web activity by inspecting all internet traffic bi-directionally and enforcing secure access rules. With a default, globally-available cloud gateway, users' web traffic can be monitored, analyzed, and controlled, regardless of locations. With a dedicated corporate network location that identifies the location of your organization, the service can accelerate access control, internet visits, and AI service use.",

Secure Access Module: Deployed to endpoints managed by Trend Vision One to ensure that internet traffic is forwarded to the Internet Access Gateway for analysis and control. Procedure Define a corporate network location, such as the corporate headquarters, a branch office, or company VPN. For more information, see Internet Access gateways and corporate network locations. Deploy the Secure Access Module to the endpoints that you want to manage to forward their web traffic to an appropriate Internet Access Gateway. Alternatively, you can create a Proxy Auto Configuration (PAC) file on the Trend Vision One console and manually deploy it to client browsers to forward web traffic from your endpoints to the Internet Access Gateway.",
