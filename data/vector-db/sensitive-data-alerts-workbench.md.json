In the Workbench app, go to All Alerts. From the Data source/processer list select Data Detection and Response. Click the Workbench ID for the alert you want to investigate. In the alert details screen, inspect and analyze the provided alert information. To investigate sensitive data, do any of the following: In the Highlights area, view the Sensitive data section to see a list of files with sensitive data for that endpoint. If there are more than two files with sensitive data, click View details to view the entire list. In the Observable Graph section, right-click a file node and select View detailed profile to view more information about the file, including data type and size and the full URI.",
