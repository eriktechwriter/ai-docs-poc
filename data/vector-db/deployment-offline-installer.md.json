Please review the Pre-Release Disclaimer before using the feature. This feature is not available in all regions. The offline installer package only supports deploying the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent in Sensor-only configuration or with Standard Endpoint Proteciton features. The Endpoint Sensor currently does not support Windows 11 ARM64. You can deploy the Standard Endpoint Protection agent package to monitor your Windows 11 ARM64 endpoints, but the Endpoint sensor detection and response feature cannot be enabled at this time. Additional support is coming soon. The offline installer package deploys the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent without requiring an internet connection during installation.",
