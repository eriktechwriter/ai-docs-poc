This task is supported by the following services: Trend Vision One Container Security Important Only currently running Kubernetes pods are supported for the Isolate Container task. The Isolate Container task allows you to limit the spread of suspicious processes within a container and investigate their causes by disconnecting the pod from relevant networks and preventing data transfer into and out of the pod. Isolating a container is preferable to terminating a container because it preserves the evidence needed to prevent the behavior from happening again. Start the task using context menus on the Trend Vision One console. Procedure After identifying the container to isolate, access the context or response menu and click Isolate Container.",
