Using a deployed Server & Workload Protection agent has the following system requirements: Relays only support 64-bit operating systems Relays do not support macOS, Solaris, AIX, or Red Hat OpenShift Relays are not supported on agents enabled for SAP Scanner. Trend Micro recommends installing relays on Linux hosts, because relays are more scalable on Linux platforms than Windows. Relay sizing information is currently not available. Based on testing, it is recommended that the host system have at least 0.5 GB more memory (RAM) allocated than what is listed in the Server & Workload Protection system requirements to enable the Endpoint Sensor on a Server & Workload Protection relay.",
