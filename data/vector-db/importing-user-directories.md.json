This helps Cloud Email Gateway Protection to better filter and process messages for valid email addresses. Messages to invalid email addresses will be rejected. Important Before you import an LDIF or CSV directory file, note the following: Cloud Email Gateway Protection only recognizes ANSI-encoded LDIF (with the extension .ldf) and ANSI or UTF-8-encoded CSV (with the extension .csv) files. Do not include blank lines or other irrelevant data in the file that you import. Use caution when creating a file. When importing user directory files, Cloud Email Gateway Protection replaces all records for a managed domain at once. If any email addresses for a managed domain are imported, all other email addresses for that domain are removed.",

To disable or enable valid recipients, go to Inbound Protection → Connection Filtering → Recipient Filter and click Disable All or Enable All.
