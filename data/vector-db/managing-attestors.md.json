Attestors are trusted Cosign public keys in PEM format used to verify the digital signatures of container images. They ensure that the images originate from a trusted source and have not been tampered with. Note To validate Trend Micro container images, see How do I verify the authenticity of Trend Micro container images with Cosign public keys?. Prerequisites: You have a Cosign public key in PEM format. This key corresponds to the private key that was used to sign your container images. For instructions on how to create a Cosign public key, see Signing Containers on the Sigstore documentation site. Your account has the necessary permissions to access the Object Management section in Container Protection.",

    "content": "Important To ensure the security and integrity of your container images, follow these best practices when managing attestors: Regularly update attestors to include new trusted keys. Remove attestors that are no longer needed or have been compromised. Ensure the corresponding private keys are stored securely by the development team and that access to them is restricted. Procedure From the Object management tab, click Attestors. To create an attestor: Click Add. On the Add attestor screen, type a name for the attestor. Select the Type of attestor. Note Currently only Cosign: Key-pair is supported. In the Public key field, paste the content of your Cosign public key file. If you want to configure transparency logs, turn the toggle to On and specify the Transparency log server and Transparency log key. Type a description. Click Save to create the attestor. To edit an attestor: Click the attestor name to open the Modify attestor screen. Update the attestor details as needed.",
