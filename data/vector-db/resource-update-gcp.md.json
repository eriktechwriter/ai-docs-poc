Note The Resource Update screen in the Trend Vision One console provides a set of commands to help complete the following steps. The parameters in each step are based on using the default parameters provided when the project was first connected. Verify the location of the deployed resource before continuing. Access the folder where the resource is located. Copy the command or type cd [directoryName]. Upload the resource creation script to your Google Cloud Shell. Google Cloud Shell uploads the resource creation script to the root directory. Move the resource creation script to the deployment folder. Copy the command or type mv ~/cloud-account-management-terraform-gcp.tf ./cloud-account-management-terraform-gcp.tf. Important The resource creation script must be the only terraform file in the directory. Having more than one terraform file in the folder interferes with deployment process and might cause the update to fail.",
