Attack Path Prediction provides a holistic view of all potential attack paths in your organization. The view enables you to understand risks on entry points, identify choke points that could facilitate multiple attack paths, and take proactive remediation actions. The following table details the actions available on the main Attack Path Prediction screen. Action Description Investigate entire attack paths and individual asset nodes Click an asset node on a specific attack path to view the associated attack path risk event description and recommended remediation steps on the left-hand menu. Right-click an asset node to see available investigation and response actions for the individual node.",
