When running on EC2 instances in AWS, the agent uses the Amazon Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) to query information about the EC2 instance. Note Support for IMDS v2 was added in agent version 12 FR 2020-05-19. If you are using an older version of the agent, only IMDS v1 is supported and you must ensure that your AWS configuration allows the agent access to host metadata using IMDS v1. The information retrieved by the agent is necessary to ensure that the agent activates under the proper AWS account within Server & Workload Protection and the right instance size is used for metered billing.",
