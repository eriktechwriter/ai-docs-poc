The detection of time-critical CVEs can indicate an ongoing zero-day attack or correspond with high-profile N-day vulnerabilities. Zero-day vulnerabilities have no patch when published, so the vulnerability can only be mitigated. N-day vulnerabilities have patches available when published, so the vulnerability can be mitigated or remediated if your operating system supports the patch. Trend Micro recommends you address all time critical CVEs immediately to bolster your security posture. When a time-critical CVE is detected in your environment, Trend Vision One displays a security alert in the Vulnerabilities tab of Cyber Risk Overview → Exposure Overview. Alerts display for 14 days and may involve one or more CVEs.",
