You can purchase credits either for files scanned, or per bucket or files scanned if you are using File Security Storage. Pay-as-you-go. You can subscribe to Trend Vision One File Security and only pay for what you deploy and use. Pay-as-you-go billing depends on your usage of the File Security services, reported on an hourly basis. You sign up for pay-as-you-go billing on the AWS Marketplace. The following table compares the pricing for File Security features for both credits and pay-as-you-go. Note You can configure File Security SDK and File Security Storage separately using credits or pay-as-you-go. The number of scans made updates every hour. If you are using pay-as-you-go for buckets, you are charged each hour that the bucket is protected, even if no scans occur. Credits vs.",
