From each screen, you can add a new policy rule and query, reorder, edit, copy, or delete existing policy rules. Note If a policy rule applies to multiple domains and your account only has permission to manage a part of these domains, the policy rule is only visible. You cannot reorder, edit, copy, or delete the policy rule. The policy screens under Inbound Protection and Outbound Protection are technically separate and can be managed independently. To go to the Inbound Protection screen, choose Email and Collaboration Security Operations → Cloud Email Gateway Protection → Inbound Protection.",
