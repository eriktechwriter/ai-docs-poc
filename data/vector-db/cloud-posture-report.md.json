This ensures that managers and administrators within an organization are updated daily on the compliance of the organization's accounts based on the Five Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Cloud Risk Management automatically generates the Cloud Risk Management Report for each account in the organization. The report includes a summary of Checks performed, the compliance status, and a list of all Checks. The Cloud Risk Management Report also provides the option to \"Resolve\" all failing Checks following the Check resolution workflow.",
