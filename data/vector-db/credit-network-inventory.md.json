You can view the current credit requirements by hovering your mouse over Credit Usage or clicking the Credit Settings icon (). For Virtual Network Sensors, average throughput is calculated on each Virtual Network Sensor up to the last 30 days. The averages are added together and rounded up to the nearest 500 Mbps to determine bandwidth usage and calculate the credit requirement. Newly deployed Virtual Network Sensors can only calculate their usage up to when the sensor was first connected to Network Inventory. Tip You can view your actual scanned bandwidth with the Monitored Network Throughput widget in the Dashboards app. The first time you choose to deploy a Virtual Network Sensor, you are given a 30-day free trial. During the trial, Network Inventory starts calculating your average scanned throughput.",
