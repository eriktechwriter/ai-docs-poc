Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to create highly realistic images, videos, or audio that are difficult to distinguish from authentic media. The synthetic creations can mimic the appearance and voices of real people, posing significant risks. Mobile Security uses advanced AI detection algorithms to identify potential deepfakes during end user video calls. Deepfake Detection identifies characteristics such as unnatural blinking patterns, unusual facial symmetry, and inconsistencies in audio-visual synchronization. By leveraging these indicators, Mobile Security can effectively flag potential deepfake technology use on managed end user devices.",

Important Deepfake Detector is currently only available for devices running iOS 14 and later. Devices must have 4GB of available memory. Assign the policy to one or more assignment groups and click Save. Instruct your end users on how to use the new feature. While on a video call, open the Mobile Security app and tap Start detection. Select Trend Micro Mobile Security and tap Start Broadcast. Return to the video call. To stop detection, slide the red icon at the top of the screen and tap Stop. Tell end users they may also start detection from the iPhone Control Center. While on a video call, open the iPhone Control Center. Touch and hold the record button until options appear. Select Trend Micro Mobile Security and tap Start Broadcast.",
