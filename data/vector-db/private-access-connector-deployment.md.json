Private Access Connectors connect your cloud-based and locally-installed applications with Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access, which allows you to control access to sensitive corporate resources. To ensure high availability (HA) and facilitate load-balancing on high traffic apps, install and group together at least 2 connectors in each environment. Before attempting to deploy the Private Access Connector, ensure that your environment meets the minimum system requirements. Note A deployment guide appears the first time you access the Private Access Configuration app to help you set up the service.",
