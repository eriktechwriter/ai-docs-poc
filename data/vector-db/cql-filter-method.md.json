CQL allows you to search by field/value pairs. The syntax allows you to specify the relationship and order in which the criteria are considered using logical operators, parentheses, and quotation marks. Contents Logical operators Wildcards Regular expressions Fields list Using CQL to filter your checks Query examples Logical operators The base syntax for a field/value search criteria is [field]:[value], where the colon character (:) specifies that the given field must be equal to the specified value in order for a check to be returned in the search results. Logical operators allow you to specify more than one criteria and to indicate the relationship between them.",
