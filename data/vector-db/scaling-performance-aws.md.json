The Lambda concurrency setting number includes not only the Lambdas that File Storage Security uses, but also all the other Lambdas used in the same AWS account. You can leave this setting at its default (set by AWS) and make sure the Lambda concurrency in this AWS account is sufficient for the File Storage Security scan. Below are some estimates of how long a scan takes and how much concurrency was used for various numbers of zipped 10 MB files. The data in the table was collected in a deployment where there was one storage stack and one scanner in the same region.",

Additionally, the concurrent executions will be further split with any other Lambdas deployed under the same AWS account in the same region. The ScannerLambda receives scan messages by setting up an event source mapping to the SQS ScannerQueue. The maximum number of batches that an event source mapping can process simultaneously is 1000, and the batch size for the ScannerLambda is 1. In other words, ScannerLambda can poll at most 1000 scan messages from the SQS ScannerQueue simultaneously, even if there are still allowable concurrent executions. The polling latency determines the actual amount of scan messages that can be handled simultaneously. If the latency is 1 second, the maximum number of scan messages that can be handled in 1 second is bound to 1000.",
