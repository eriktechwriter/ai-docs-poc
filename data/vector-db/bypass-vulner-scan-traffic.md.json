Create a new IP list from the vulnerability scan provider IP range or addresses Create firewall rules for incoming and outbound scan traffic Assign the new firewall rules to a policy to bypass vulnerability scans After these firewall rules have been assigned to the new policy, Server & Workload Protection will ignore ANY traffic from the IPs you have added in your IP List. Server & Workload Protection will not scan the vulnerability management provider traffic for stateful issues or vulnerabilities - it will be allowed through untouched.",
