Please review the Pre-Release Disclaimer before using the feature. These features are not available in all regions. Endpoint Security Policies supports agent version 202507 and later. Assigning policies to older agent versions might cause unwanted behavior or fail. Enabling Web Reputation on older agent versions might cause agents to install the browser extension even if the feature is disabled. Web Reputation uses several policy resources for configuring access and monitoring rules. Configure the resources before configuring Web Reputation.

Low: Blocks websites determined by Trend Micro to be dangerous. To block access to untested websites, select Block pages that have not been tested by Trend Micro. To check if Trend Micro has tested a specific website, go to the Trend Micro Site Safety Center. To configure which domains and URLs to block and which to allow, configure the Web access rules. Note Web Reputation only supports selecting one each domain and URL web lists for Allow without logging, and one each for Block. You can configure your web lists in Policy Resources.
