The rules enable you to respond to risky behavior or suspicious entities and activities in your environment, so that you can perform dynamic control over access to internal and cloud applications by risk, identity, time, and location.

Check secure access rule details Click the Risk Control, Private Access Control or Internet Access Control tab to view all the configured rules for your organization.
