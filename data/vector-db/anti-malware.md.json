To identify threats, the Anti-Malware module checks files on the local hard drive against a comprehensive threat database. The Anti-Malware module also checks files for certain characteristics, such as compression and known exploit code. Portions of the threat database are hosted on Trend Micro servers or stored locally as patterns. Agents periodically download anti-malware patterns and updates to ensure protection against the latest threats. Note A newly-installed agent cannot provide anti-malware protection until it has contacted an update server to download anti-malware patterns and updates. Ensure that your agents can communicate with a relay or the Trend Micro Update Server after installation.",

    "content": "What is grayware? Although they exhibit what can be intrusive behavior, some spyware-like applications are considered legitimate. For example, some commercially available remote control and monitoring applications can track and collect system events and then send information about these events to another system. System administrators and other users may find themselves installing these legitimate applications. These applications are called \"grayware\". To provide protection against the illegitimate use of grayware, the Anti-Malware module detects grayware but provides an option to \"approve\" detected applications and allow them to run.
