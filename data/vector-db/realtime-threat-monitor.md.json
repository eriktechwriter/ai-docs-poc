Once you create the required resources, events from the cloud account appear on the RTPM event monitoring dashboard, and a subset of Rules start to update based on these events. We provide both Powershell and Bash scripts to set up RTPM. Note For AWS Accounts: Real-Time Posture Montoring can be enabled through Account Management in Trend Vision One. For Azure and Google Cloud Accounts: You can enable the feature by running the executable scripts mentioned in the sections below.
