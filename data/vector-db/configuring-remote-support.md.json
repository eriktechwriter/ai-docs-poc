Procedure Go to Administration → Support Settings. Use the check boxes to enable the following remote support tasks: Allow Trend Micro support engineers to collect the diagnostic package from Endpoint Security. Allow Trend Micro support engineers to remotely deploy utilities to endpoint agents for troubleshooting and mitigation. Important There is a dependency between both remote support settings. Allowing Trend Micro support engineers to remotely deploy utilities to endpoint agents automatically enables diagnostic package collection from Endpoint Security. Disabling diagnostic package collection automatically disables remote utility deployment. Choose between Automatic approval and Manual approval for the enabled remote support tasks.",
