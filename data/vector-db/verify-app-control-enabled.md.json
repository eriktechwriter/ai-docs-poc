    "content": "Depending on your enforcement setting for unrecognized software, it should be either blocked or allowed. Once Application Control has built initial allow rules or downloaded a shared ruleset, if any change is detected, it should appear in the Actions tab, which you can use to create allow and block rules (see Monitor new and changed software). Depending on your alert configuration, you will also see an alert if unrecognized software is detected, or if Application Control blocks software from launching (see Monitor Application Control events). The event should persist until the software change no longer exists, or until the oldest data has been removed from the database. Add an allow or block rule for your test software and then try again. This time, Application Control should apply your allow or block rule.",
