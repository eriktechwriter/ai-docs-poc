This task is supported by the following services: Trend Vision One Container Security Important Only currently running Kubernetes pods or ECS tasks are supported for the Terminate Container task. Terminating a pod destroys evidence of the suspicious behavior and does not prevent the behavior from happening again. If possible, run the Isolate Container task before deciding to terminate a container. The Terminate Container task allows you to stop the spread of suspicious behavior within a container by terminating the containing pod. Once terminated, a pod cannot be resumed. Start the task using context menus on the Trend Vision One console.",
