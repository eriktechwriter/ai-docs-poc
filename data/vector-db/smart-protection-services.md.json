Connected products can utilize the Service Gateway as a forward proxy to the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network or as a standalone Smart Protection Server.\n\nAdditionally, Smart Protection Services includes the Smart Protection Network proxy which facilitates routing traffic to Trend Micro services using a Trend Micro hosted proxy, reducing the firewall and port requirements.\n\n1.  To install and enable Smart Protection Services, see [Managing services in Service Gateway](managing-services-service-gateway.md).\n\n    After enabling Smart Protection Services, access the settings screen to view the File Reputation Services and Web Reputation Services URLs and to enable the Smart Protection Network Proxy.",
