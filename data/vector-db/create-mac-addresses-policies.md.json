A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each created in a different policy. Tip To create a MAC list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it. MAC lists support MAC addresses in both hyphen- and colon-separated formats, for example 0A-0F-FF-F0-A0-AF and 0A:0F:FF:F0:A0:AF. You can insert comments into your MAC list by preceding the text with a pound sign (\"#\"). Procedure Click Policies → Common Objects → Lists → MAC Lists. Click New → New MAC List. Type a name and, optionally, a description. In the MAC(s) list, add the MAC addresses, one per line. Click OK. Next steps Import and export MAC lists You can export one or more MAC lists to an XML or CSV file, and import lists from an XML file.",
