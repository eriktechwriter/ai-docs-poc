Solutions Use a proxy Install a Smart Protection Server locally Disable the features that use Trend Micro security services Use a proxy If your agents or relay-enabled agents can't connect to the internet, you can install a proxy that can. Your agents and relays connect to the proxy, and the proxy then connects outbound to the Trend Micro security services in the Smart Protection Network.

Install a Smart Protection Server locally If your agents and relay-enabled agents can't connect to the internet, you can install a Smart Protection Server in your local area network (LAN) to which they can connect. The local Smart Protection Server periodically connects outbound over the internet to the Smart Protection Network to retrieve the latest Smart Scan Anti-Malware patterns and Web Reputation information. This information is cached on the Smart Protection Server and queried by your agents and relay-enabled agents. The Smart Protection Server does not push updates to the air-gapped agents or relay-enabled agents. If you decide to use this solution, remember that: Functionality is limited. Only the Smart Scan and Web Reputation features are supported with a local Smart Protection Server. Use the proxy solution if you need the behavior monitoring, predictive machine learning, and process memory scanning features.",
