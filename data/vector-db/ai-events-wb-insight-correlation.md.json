These recommendations help you: Discover related activity that may not have been initially included in the insight. Add relevant events directly to the insight for further correlation. This feature can give you a more complete and accurate picture of a potential incident and accelerate your investigation by uncovering hidden connections and suspicious activity that might otherwise go unnoticed.
