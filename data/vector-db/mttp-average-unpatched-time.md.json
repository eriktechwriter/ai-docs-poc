To better assist you in determining and responding to your company's vulnerabilities, Trend Micro designed certain metrics to complement each other for greater clarity. The Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) and Average Unpatched Time (AUT) metrics work together to help you evaluate your company's typical response time for installing important patches on vulnerable Windows operating systems. The MTTP metric represents devices that have had patches installed in the past. If no patches have been installed on a device, the device will not be considered in the MTTP calculation. AUT represents all devices with detected unpatched vulnerabilities. Even if your MTTP is low, you must still consider AUT to get a full picture of unpatched vulnerabilities in your environment.",

    "content": "For example: Your organization has a MTTP of 10 days, which is a good value. When viewing details for your AUT, you discover three devices that have never been patched with an AUT of over 180 days. The unpatched devices require immediate attention. However, the devices are not included in the MTTP calculation because the devices have never been patched. AUT helps identify vulnerable devices that MTTP cannot. Similarly, a high MTTP and a low AUT also indicates vulnerable devices that require attention. Keep both metrics low to ensure your organization's devices are secure and up-to-date. Important MTTP and AUT only apply to devices running supported Windows operating systems. Metric Description Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) Calculated by subtracting the release date of important Windows KBs from the time you installed the KB on endpoints and then averaged out across all supported endpoints.",
