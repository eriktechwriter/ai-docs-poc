IP address or FQDN: Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a unique name, which includes both host name and domain name, and resolves to a single IP address. Port: Port is a number from 1 to 65535 that an inbound server listens on. These ports vary based on server configuration. Preference: Preference, sometimes referred to as distance, is a value from 1 to 100. The lower the preference value, the higher the priority. If more than one mail server is available, delivery is prioritized to servers with lower values. Using the same value will balance delivery to each server. Note You can specify up to 100 inbound servers and 100 outbound servers. Use the add and the remove buttons to manage additional entries. Here is an example to explain how messages are routed to inbound servers based on preference values.",
