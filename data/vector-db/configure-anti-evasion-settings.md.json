Anti evasion settings are configured in a policy or an individual computer. The Security Posture setting controls how rigorous intrusion prevention analyzes packets, and can be set to one of the following values: Normal: Prevents the evasion of intrusion prevention rules without false positives. This is the default value. Strict: Performs more stringent checking than Normal mode but can produce some false-positive results. Strict mode is useful for penetration testing but should not be enabled under normal circumstances. Custom: If you select Custom, additional settings are available that enable you to specify how the agent will handle issues with packets.",

    "content": "For these settings (with the exception of TCP Timestamp PAWS Window), the options are Allow (the agent sends the packet through to the system) or Deny Silent (same behavior as Deny, but no event is logged): Note Deny (the agent drops the packet and logs an event) is not a customizable option. Setting Description Normal value Strict value Default custom value (pre-10.2) Default custom value (10.2 or later) Invalid TCP Timestamps Action to take when a TCP timestamp is too old Ignore (same function as Allow) Deny Deny Ignore (same function as Allow) TCP Timestamp PAWS Window Packets can have timestamps. When a timestamp has an earlier timestamp than the one that came before it, it can be suspicious. The tolerance for the difference in timestamps depends on the operating system. For Windows systems, select 0 (the system will only accept packets with a timestamp that is equal to or newer than the previous packet).",
