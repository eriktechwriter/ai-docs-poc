Application Types are useful for grouping intrusion prevention rules.that have a common purpose. Rule groups simplify the process of selecting a set of intrusion prevention rules to assign to a computer. For example, consider the set of rules required to protect HTTP traffic to an Oracle Report Server. Simply select the rules in the \"Web Server Common\" and \"Web Server Oracle Report Server\" application types and then exclude unneeded rules, such as the rules that are specific to IIS servers. See a list of application types Open the list of application types where you can see the properties of existing application types, as well as configure, export, and duplicate them. You can export to XML or CSV files.",
