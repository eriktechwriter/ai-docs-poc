    "content": "Review how the Runtime Proxy policies and endpoint agents utilize priority to determine how to connect to Trend Vision One.\n\nHow an endpoint agent connects to Trend Vision One depends on a combination of priority and availability. Endpoints connect to whichever proxy is both available and has a higher priority.\n\nAvailability is determined through probing. Agents probe for a connection every 10 minutes. Once a successful connection to a proxy or Service Gateway is established, the agent maintains that connection for the next 10 minutes, even if the proxy or Service Gateway becomes unavailable during those 10 minutes.\n\nA proxy or Service Gateways is considered unavailable if the agent connection times out or fails. The endpoint agent has a timeout setting of one (1) minute for each step of the HTTPS request: DNS look-up, TCP connection, HTTPS response. If a connection fails, the agent does not wait for the timeout before attempting to find another available proxy or Service Gateway.",
