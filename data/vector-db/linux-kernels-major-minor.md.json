This allows Container Security to support any Linux kernel version 5.8 or later, as long as the BTF types are exposed. If you are using runtime scanning in an ECS instance, you must use a kernel whose version is 5.8 or later. The following is a non-exclusive list of the kernel version flavors supported by Container Security.
