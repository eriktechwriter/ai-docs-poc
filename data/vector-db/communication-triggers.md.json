You can filter the Checks that trigger notifications using check/rule attributes and compliance standards. By default, the filter is set to 'All checks', meaning that you will be notified of all the failing Checks across all the Categories and Risk Level. An alert consists of rule details including Account name, Risk Level, Region, Resource, Description, and Introduced by: \"user name\" (only for the RTPM Rules). The alerts also include ARN with an exception to Email and SMS communication channels. Note For SNS and PagerDuty's channels ARN is displayed as providerResourceId.",
