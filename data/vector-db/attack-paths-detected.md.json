Attack Path Prediction uses threat detection, behavior analysis, vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning, and asset relationships and profile analysis to predict potential attack paths. Cyber Risk Exposure Management core features and generative AI help determine likely entry point assets, potential targets, paths an attacker may take, and steps needed to remediate vulnerable assets. All attack paths require: Entry point assets with risk detections indicating the asset is vulnerable to compromise A potential path for lateral movement High-value critical assets that serve as desirable target points for attackers To learn more, see Attack path components.",

A vulnerable entry point asset, high-value target asset, and relationships between the assets are identified: A server on the network is exposed to the internet and contains a known vulnerability and a misconfiguration. An \"administrator\" user has a relationship with the server, allowing the user to sign in to the system. The \"administrator\" user is assigned the \"global admin\" role, allowing the user full system privileges. The global admin role can view and edit a highly critical user account. A likely lateral movement path is predicted: Attackers access the server from the internet and exploit the vulnerability to gain network access. The attackers use the administrator credentials to sign in and assume the \"global admin\" role. With full system privileges, the attackers can compromise the critical user account and potentially steal data or move deeper into the network.",
