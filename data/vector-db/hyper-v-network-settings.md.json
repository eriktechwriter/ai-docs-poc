Once your Virtual Network Sensor has successfully connected to Network Inventory, use the table below to find the recommended configurations for your network environment based on your throughput and traffic type. Traffic type is determined by how data is passed from the monitored appliance to the Virtual Network Sensor: Internal traffic is passed from the monitored appliance to a Virtual Network Sensor on the same host system through a virtual switch. External traffic is passed from the monitored appliance to the Virtual Network Sensor via an external network switch. Generally, the monitored appliance is not on the same system as the Virtual Network Sensor, but can be in the case of monitoring VM-to-VM traffic or when using PCI passthrough.",
