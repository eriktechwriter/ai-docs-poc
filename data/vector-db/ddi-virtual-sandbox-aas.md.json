Objects normally sent to the Virtual Analyzer for analysis are instead analyzed in the cloud by Sandbox as a Service. The results are sent to [Sandbox Analysis](sandbox-analysis.md) where they can be viewed. Additionally, suspicious objects are sent to [Suspicious Object Management](suspicious-object-management.md).\n\n:::note\nConnecting to a Service Gateway is not required to integrate with Sandbox as a Service.\n\nObjects analyzed by Sandbox as a Service do not count towards the daily reserve for Sandbox Analysis.\n:::",
