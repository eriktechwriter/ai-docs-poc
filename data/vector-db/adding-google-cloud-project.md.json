Adding a Google Cloud (formerly Google Cloud Platform) project to the Cloud Accounts app allows Trend Vision One to access your cloud service to provide security and visibility into your cloud assets. Before you begin, review the permission requirements for connecting a Google Cloud project to Cloud Accounts. Important If you have access to the Agentless Vulnerability and Threat Detection feature for Google Cloud, see Adding a Google Cloud project (January 2025 update) to connect your project. The steps are valid as of March 2024. Procedure Sign in to the Trend Vision One console. In a new tab in the same browser session, sign in to the Google Cloud project you want to connect and access the Cloud Shell.",

While you can specify any directory name you want, you must ensure the folder has a unique name and that there are no other terraform files in the deployment folder. Upload the resource creation script to your Google Cloud Shell. Google Cloud Shell uploads the resource creation script to the root directory. Move the resource creation script to the deployment folder. Copy the command or type mv ~/cloud-account-management-terraform-gcp.tf ./cloud-account-management-terraform-gcp.tf. Important The resource creation script must be the only terraform file in the directory. Having more than one terraform file in the folder interferes with deployment process and might cause the connection to fail. Initiate Terraform and apply the resource creation script. Copy the command or type terraform init && terraform apply.",
