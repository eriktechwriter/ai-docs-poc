This helps the organization with different asset visibility scopes to manage their security playbooks effectively. If the creator's user role is deleted, the playbook becomes deactivated until another user reactivates it by editing or enabling the playbook. Upon reactivation, the playbook applies to targets within the asset visibility scope of the user who reactivated it. Workflow and Automation → Security Playbooks © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
