To run cloud attack simulations, you need to enable Trend Vision One Container Security and configure the T1552.001 ruleset. Then you can execute a command in a Linux container to trigger the simulated attack and review the results. Procedure Enable Trend Vision One Container Security Learn how to enable and configure Container Security Configure the T1552.001 rulesetLearn more about configuring rulesets in Container Security Run the cloud attack simulation by executing the following command in a Linux container monitored by Container Security: find / -name \"credentials\" -path \"*/.aws/credentials\" 2>/dev/null Review the simulation results: In the Trend Vision One console, go to the Workben",
