The \"Sensor disabled\" Available Action now only includes endpoints which have the Trend Vision One sensor installed but disabled by settings or policy. Additionally, a new category of filters has been added for Sensor Maintenance Recommended. You can follow the recommended actions to resolve any issue the endpoints might have.
