Blocking permissions disconnects Microsoft Entra ID from the apps but does not delete or revoke the permissions in Microsoft Entra ID. To delete the permissions in Microsoft Entra ID, you must delete the associated enterprise application (see step 4).\n\n:::warning[Important]\n- Blocking Microsoft Entra ID permissions can negatively impact the functionality of associated apps. Blocking permissions can limit the insights provided by associated apps, and you may lose the ability to perform account-related actions, such as mobile device authentication, disabling user accounts, and forcing password reset.",
