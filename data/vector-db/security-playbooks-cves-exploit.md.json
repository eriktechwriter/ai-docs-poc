It allows you to create the playbooks from scratch with a flexible workflow, while still allowing you to create the playbooks from a fully customizable template. The updated playbook templates provide the following new filtering options to help mitigate risks posed by highly-exploitable CVEs on your managed assets for more fine-grained control: Filter targets by more operating systems, vulnerability process status, and Trend solutions for prevention rules Retrieve the number of assets targeted for the playbook right after the target configuration Notify recipients of playbook results by individual CVE or all CVEs For more information, see Create CVEs with Global Exploit Activity playbooks.",
