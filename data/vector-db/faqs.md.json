When \"comprehensive mail storage\" is enabled, Gmail stores a copy of emails in the recipient’s mailbox before forwarding them to Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection for scanning, which leads Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection working in Gmail (Inline Mode) to scan emails only after they have already arrived in the user’s mailbox, rather than before. If Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection makes changes on an email, such as tagging the subject, the user will see two duplicate emails in their mailbox.",
