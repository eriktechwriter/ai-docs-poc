Adding an Azure subscription to the Cloud Accounts app allows Trend Vision One to access your cloud service to provide security and visibility into your cloud assets. Before you begin, review the permission requirements and region limitations for connecting an Azure subscription to Cloud Accounts. Important The steps are valid for Azure Cloud Shell as of December, 2023. Procedure Sign in to the Trend Vision One console. In a new tab in the same browser session, sign in to the Azure subscription you want to connect and access the Azure Cloud Shell. In the Trend Vision One console, go to Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → Azure. In the Cloud Accounts screen, click Add.The Add Azure Subscription screen appears.",
