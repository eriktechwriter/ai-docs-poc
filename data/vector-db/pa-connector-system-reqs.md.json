Instead, configure the VM to reserve at least the number of vCPUs and memory listed in the system requirements. Trend Micro suggests deploying more private access connectors with lower specifications rather than fewer connectors with higher specifications. This approach enhances horizontal scalability. For instance, if you have fewer higher-specification connectors and one fails, it could disrupt a large amount of user application traffic or sessions. The failure of a lower specification but more numerous connector would have a lesser impact.",
