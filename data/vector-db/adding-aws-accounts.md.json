Update your legacy connections in Cloud Accounts to enable advanced Trend Vision One Cloud Security features and capabilities. You can still perform some management functions with Server & Workload Protection, as well as add, modify, or remove AWS accounts using API functions. However, Trend Micro recommends updating to the Cloud Accounts app to take full advantage of security benefits Trend Vision One has to offer for your containers and other cloud assets.",
