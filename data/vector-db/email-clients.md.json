Data Loss Prevention checks the email subject, body, and attachments for data identifiers. For a list of supported email clients, see the Data Protection Lists document at: http://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/data-protection-reference-documents.aspx Monitoring occurs when a user attempts to send the email. If the email contains data identifiers, Data Loss Prevention will either allow or block the email. You can define non-monitored internal email domains and monitored subdomains. Non-monitored email domains: Data Loss Prevention immediately allows the transmission of emails sent to non-monitored domains. Note Data transmissions to non-monitored email domains and to monitored email subdomains where \"Monitor\" is the action are similar in that the transmission is allowed.",

Monitored email subdomains: When Data Loss Prevention detects email transmitted to a monitored subdomain, it checks the action for the policy. Depending on the action, the transmission is allowed or blocked. Note If you select email clients as a monitored channel, an email must match a policy for it to be monitored. In contrast, an email sent to monitored email subdomains is automatically monitored, even if it does not match a policy. Specify domains using any of the following formats, separating multiple domains with commas: X400 format, such as /O=Trend/OU=USA, /O=Trend/OU=China Email domains, such as example.com For email messages sent through the SMTP protocol, Data Loss Prevention checks if the target SMTP server is on the following lists: Monitored targets Non-monitored targets Non-monitored em",
