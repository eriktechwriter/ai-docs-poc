Adding an AWS organization forces accounts managed by that organization to apply the same settings configured for the entire organization. Settings cannot be modified for individual accounts added as part of an organization. To apply different configurations to individual accounts managed by an AWS organization, you must add those accounts separately. Either add the accounts before adding your AWS organization, or use the OrganizationExcludedAccounts parameter to exclude those accounts from the stack deployment. The Cloud Accounts app currently only supports connecting organizations using the CloudFormation stack template. Due to limitations of AWS, StackSets does not deploy resources to your management account. To add your management account, see Adding an AWS account using CloudFormation.
