In your Trend Vision One console, go to **Endpoint Security â†’ Endpoint Inventory**.\n\n    The first time you visit Endpoint Inventory, Trend Vision One provisions the app. Once the process is complete, Endpoint Inventory opens and the **Get Started with Endpoint Inventory** screen appears. You can review the steps or close the screen.\n\n2.  Configure a proxy connection and review the firewall requirements.\n\n    Trend Micro recommends deploying a Service Gateway with the Forward Proxy Service to help reduce and manage agent bandwidth usage within your security network.\n\n    Otherwise, configure your proxy settings for installation and runtime in the [Global Settings menu](global-settings-endpoint-inventory.md) to ensure your agents can connect to Trend Vision One if a Service Gateway is not available.",
