The module does this by comparing current conditions to a previously recorded baseline. Server & Workload Protection has predefined Integrity Monitoring rules and provides new Integrity Monitoring rules in security updates. Integrity Monitoring detects changes made to the system, but does not prevent or undo the changes. Note You need a Workload license to enable integrity monitoring. Enable Integrity Monitoring You can enable Integrity Monitoring in policies or at the computer level. Enabling Integrity Monitoring involves several procedures: Procedure Turn on Integrity Monitoring. Run a Recommendation scan. Apply the Integrity Monitoring rules. Build a baseline for the computer.",
