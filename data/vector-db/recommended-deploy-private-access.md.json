How do you deploy Private Access? To manage access permissions for your applications, it is essential to creating Private Access Rules. Scenario Your company operates with two independent VLANs that cannot communicate with each other and are not accessible from outside their respective networks. Each VLAN hosts several internal services. Two employees, who are outside the networks, are attempting to access these services. Your VLANs and internal services VLAN Internal Service VLAN_1 Service_1 Service_2 VLAN_2 Service_3 Service_4 Deploy Connector group First, you create a connector group and deploy the connector. The connector group serves to expose the VLANs, allowing external users to access the internal services hosted within them.",

    "content": "Since you have 2 independent VLANS, you must deploy 2 connectors — one in VLAN_1 and one in VLAN_2. Create internal application After deploying the connector, it is essential to add the internal applications in the Trend Vision One console to enable the connector to identify which applications it can access on the internal network. Since you have 4 services for user access, you need to create 4 internal applications corresponding to these services. In this scenario, when adding Service_1 and Service_2 as internal applications, both services should be assigned to Connector Group 1, as this connector group is deployed in the same VLAN as the services. Conversely, Service_3 and Service_4 should be assigned to Connector Group 2 Note Now we are setting up the Internal Applications, users will be able to access these applications through devices equipped with the Secure Access Module. However, access to certain internal applications is restricted to users with permanent permissions.",
