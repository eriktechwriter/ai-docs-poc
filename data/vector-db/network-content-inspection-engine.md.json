Important The Network Content Inspection Engine for Endpoint Sensor only supports Windows 64-bit (x86-64) environments. Functionality is limited for operating systems older than Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019. For Standard Endpoint Protection deployments, the Network Content Inspection Engine for Endpoint Sensor operates cocurrently with Network Content Inspection Engine for Standard Endpoint Protection. The Network Content Inspection Engine is a powerful new enhancement integrated into the Endpoint Sensor. The Network Content Inspection Engine provides granular visibility into network communications to detect and track the network activity of possible threats.",

The first time you access the Endpoint Security Policies screen, you might see a message about the new Network Content Inspection Engine. Your deployed endpoint agents do not install the new component until after you enable Endpoint sensor detection and response in a policy for the first time. Click Okay to proceed to the policy list. The first time you enable Endpoint sensor detection and response in a policy, another message appears to confirm the installation of the Network Content Inspection Engine on your agents.
