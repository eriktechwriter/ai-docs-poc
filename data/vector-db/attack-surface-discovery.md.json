Attack Surface Discovery allows you to locate corporate assets that threat actors might be able to use to attack your organization. Each section of the Attack Surface Discovery app provides insights into an asset type within your organization. Important You must allocate credits to Cyber Risk Exposure Management to fully access Attack Surface Discovery. Customers with XDR sensor entitlements that have not allocated credits to Cyber Risk Exposure Management have limited access to the asset profile screens related to their XDR sensors.
