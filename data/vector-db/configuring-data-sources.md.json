Trend Vision One allows you to connect multiple Trend Micro or third-party data sources to Cyber Risk Exposure Management in order to gain extra visibility into your organization’s attack surface, risk indicators, and vulnerabilities. The more data sources you connect to Cyber Risk Exposure Management, the more complete a picture you can get of your organization's security posture. Different data sources have different requirements when connecting to Cyber Risk Exposure Management. The following procedure outlines the basic steps required to connect a data source. Procedure Go to Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Threat and Exposure Management. Click the Data sources button in the upper right.",
