The Trust Relationships tab allows you to view domains that have established trust relationships with the current domain you selected in the DOMAIN section on the left panel. Users authorized to authenticate into one domain can also authenticate into trusted domains with a relationship to the user's primary domain. The more trusted domains you have, the more resources users can access across the system. Limit or restrict trust relationships for domains to ensure users only have access to necessary resources. The following table details the columns on the Trust Relationships tab. Column name Description Domain name Name of a domain that has a trust relationship with the current selected domain.",

Incoming: The current domain is trusted by the listed domain, allowing users from the current domain to access resources in the listed domain. Disabled: The trust relationship between the current domain and the listed domain is disabled. Trust attributes Flags that define properties, behaviors, and restrictions for a trust relationship.
