You can use the Log Maintenance screen to manually delete log entries by type. WARNING Manually deleting log data may affect report generation. Trend Micro Apex Central automatically deletes logs from Trend Micro servers after 90 days for new customers. Note If you are an existing customer and previously changed the default Maximum Log Age, Trend Micro Apex Central retains logs on Trend Micro servers according to the previously configured setting. Tip Trend Micro recommends backing up Data Loss Prevention logs to your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) server and keeping the logs for at least 2 years. Procedure Go to Detections → Logs → Log Maintenance. The Log Maintenance screen appears.",
