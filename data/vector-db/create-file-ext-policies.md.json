A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each created in a different rule. For example, one list of file extensions can be used by multiple malware scan configurations as files to include in a scan. Another list of file extensions can be used by multiple malware scan configurations as files to exclude from a scan. Tip To create a file extension list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it. You can insert comments into your list by preceding the text with a pound sign (\"#\"). Procedure Click Policies → Common Objects → Lists → File Extension Lists. Click New → New File Extension List. Type a name and, optionally, a description. In the File Extension(s) list, add the extensions, one per line.",
