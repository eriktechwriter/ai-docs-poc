Unmanaged devices cannot use the static outbound IP from public or home networks. To use this feature, the user must either: Deploy the Secure Access Module to all endpoints, or Add the Internet Access Cloud gateway with their corporate public IP address. If outbound static IP settings are enabled, Trend Vision One provisions your organization with two fixed-bandwidth static IP addresses based in a chosen regional point-of-presence (PoP). Selected outbound web traffic is forwarded through the provisioned static IP addresses rather than dynamically assigned IP addresses, allowing access to web resources that only accept static IP address requests.",
