To increase accuracy and reduce false positives, Trend Micro Web Reputation Services assigns reputation scores to specific pages or links within sites instead of classifying or blocking entire sites, since often, only portions of legitimate sites are hacked and reputations can change dynamically over time. Attackers may use phishing websites that disguise as legitimate websites to steal user credentials that provide access to your network.",

By crawling the web pages of these URLs in real time, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection determines whether the pages contain malicious patterns and takes pre-configured actions to keep users from zero-day phishing attacks. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also leverages artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer vision to protect cloud service users against credential phishing attacks. It uses this advanced technology to recognize key elements of a valid cloud service logon page to help prevent users from submitting credentials to untrusted sites and help them get rid of account compromise.",
