However, the iptables service is used for more than just firewall (for example, Docker manages iptables rules as part of its normal operation), so disabling it sometimes had negative consequences. With agent version 10.2 and higher, the functionality around iptables has changed. The agent no longer disables iptables. (If iptables is enabled, it stays enabled after the agent installation. If iptables is disabled, it stays disabled.) However, if the iptables service is running, the agent requires certain iptables rules, as described below. Rules required by the agent If iptables is enabled on the computer where the agent is being installed, iptables may require additional rules.",

This is required when the agent is acting as a relay, so that the relay can distribute software updates. (For more information, see Distribute security and software updates with relays.)
