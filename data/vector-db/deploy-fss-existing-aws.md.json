The first time you time deploy a File Security Storage stack, it, by default, monitors all the S3 buckets in which EventBridge is on. When you add or remove the monitoring buckets, File Security Storage stores the list of monitoring buckets in the config. File Security Storage scans buckets based on the config. (This behavior is for backward compatibility.",

In stack versions 1.2.0 or greater, File Security Storage creates an S3 configuration bucket in your environment. it uses the information in this configuration bucket to determine whether to scan a specific bucket.
