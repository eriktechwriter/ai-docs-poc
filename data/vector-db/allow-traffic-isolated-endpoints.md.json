However, network isolation sometimes hinders incident response, as trusted channels in your environment are also blocked. The Response Management app allows you to specify inbound and outbound network traffic exceptions for specific IPv4 addresses.\n\n:::warning[Important]\nYou can only allow network traffic for isolated Windows or macOS endpoints running Endpoint Sensor or the Apex One Security Agent.\n:::",
