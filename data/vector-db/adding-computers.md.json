For more information, see Deploy agents. Computers added using this method do not support the endpoint sensor and do not have XDR functionality. Trend Micro recommends only using this method for testing purposes or troubleshooting with your support provider. The Computers page in the Server & Workload Protection console enables you to manage and monitor the computers you are protecting with Server & Workload Protection. This page regularly refreshes itself to display the most current information. To modify the refresh rate for the active user, from within Server & Workload Protection, click Server & Workload Protection User Properties at the top of the screen, then click the Settings tab.",

Add computers to Server & Workload Protection Note After being installed on a computer, an agent must be activated by Server & Workload Protection. During activation, Server & Workload Protection sends a fingerprint to the agent, after which the agent accepts instructions only from a Server & Workload Protection instance with that unique fingerprint. You can add computers through the Computers page. Group computers Creating computer groups is useful from an organizational point of view and it speeds up the process of applying and managing policies. Groups are displayed in the tree structure on the left side of the Computers page. To create a new group, select the computer group under which you want to create the new computer group and then click Add → Create Group(s). To move a computer to a group, select the computer and click Actions → Move to Group.",

Moving a computer from one computer group to another has no effect on the policy assigned to that computer. To remove a group, right-click it and click Remove Group. You can only remove a computer group if it contains no computers and has no sub-groups. You can also Group computers dynamically with smart folders.

Exporting is useful when you want to back up your computer information or integrate it with other reporting systems.

To export this configuration information use the Policy export option in the Policies page.",
