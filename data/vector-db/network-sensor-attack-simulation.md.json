Refer to the Environmental requirements instructions provided in the simulation description. Procedure Configure port 445 on both Windows endpoints to enable file sharing. Open the Trend Vision One console on one of the endpoints. On the Trend Vision One console, click the Resource Center icon (). Click Simulations. Click Network Attack. The Network Attack Simulations window appears. Click Download Demo Script to download an archive file. Extract the archive file on the target endpoint. Note The archive file is password protected. Copy the password provided in the Simulations window. Run the .ps1 demo script file on the Windows endpoint. The Windows Command Prompt opens.",
