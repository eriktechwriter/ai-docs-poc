    "content": "Select either: Use Manager Instance Role: The more secure option to configure cross-account access. Attach a policy with the sts:AssumeRole permission to the Server & Workload Protection instance role, then select this option. Does not appear if Server & Workload Protection does not have an instance role. Use AWS Access Keys: Create the keys and attach a policy with the sts:AssumeRole permission before you select this option, and then type the Access Key and Secret Key. Application control Each time you create an Application Control ruleset or change it, it must be distributed to all computers that use it. Shared rulesets are bigger than local rulesets. Shared rulesets are also often applied to many servers. If they all downloaded the ruleset directly from the manager at the same time, high load could cause slower performance. Global rulesets have the same considerations. Using relays can solve this problem.",

WARNING Verify compatibility with your deployment before using relays.
