All rules are applied to the network traffic before they proceed up the protocol stack. Tap mode: Packet streams are not modified. The traffic is still processed by Web Reputation, if it's enabled. However any issues detected do not result in packet or connection drops. When in Tap mode, Server & Workload Protection offers no protection beyond providing a record of events. In tap mode, the live stream is not modified. All operations are performed on the replicated stream. When in tap mode, Server & Workload Protection offers no protection beyond providing a record of events.",
