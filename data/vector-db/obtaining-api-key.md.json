Ensure that you create an API key specifically for the endpoint you are calling (for example, create an API Key for the “us-east-1” region if you are planning to call the “us-east-1” endpoint to ensure proper authorization). Refer to the region flags to see a list of supported regions associated with the respective API key. You must add the API key account to a role with the correct permission. Select Run artifact scan for Code Security and Run container image scan for Container Security. Note The \"Run artifact scan\" permission in Code Security and the \"Run container image scan\" permission in Container Protection share the same settings. If one of these permissions is selected, then the other is also enabled.",
