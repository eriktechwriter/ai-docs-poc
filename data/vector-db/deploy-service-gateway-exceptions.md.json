Install a Service Gateway and enable the Forward proxy feature to minimize the overhead associated with configuring firewall exceptions. You can also set up backup proxy sources in your Endpoint Inventory Global Settings in the event that your Service Gateway connection is unavailable. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, go to Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management. For customers that do not have an existing Service Gateway deployed, install a Service Gateway. Click Download Virtual Appliance to open the Service Gateway Virtual Appliance panel. Select either VMware ESXi (OVA) or Microsoft Hyper-V (VHD) as the image type you want to use.",
