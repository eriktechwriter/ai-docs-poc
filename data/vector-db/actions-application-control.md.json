Next steps Tips for handling changes For most environments, we suggest that you select the Allow unrecognized software until it is explicitly blocked option to allow software changes by default when you first enable Application Control and add allow and block rules for changes that you see on the Actions page. Eventually, the rate of software changes should decrease. At that point, you could consider blocking software changes by default and creating allow rules for the software that you know is good. Some organizations prefer to continue to allow changes by default and monitor the Actions page for software that should be blocked. You may prefer to start by evaluating security events, rather than dealing with unrecognized software first.",

When an unrecognized file is allowed to execute and you want to continue to allow it, create an Allow rule. In addition to allowing the file's execution, the event is no longer logged for that file, which reduces noise and makes important events easier to find. When a known file's execution is blocked, consider cleaning that file from the computer, especially for repeated occurrences. Keep in mind that software changes are listed for each computer where they occur. You must allow or block the software for each computer. Rules are assigned to computers, not to policies. For example, if helloworld.py is detected on three computers, when you click Allow All or Block All, this would affect only three computers. It won't affect future detections on other computers, because they have their own rulesets.",
