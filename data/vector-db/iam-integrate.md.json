Zero Trust Secure Access supports the following IAM systems: Azure AD Okta Active Directory (on-premises) OpenLDAP You must grant certain permissions within your IAM system to enable Zero Trust Secure Access to monitor user sign-in attempts, access user data, and perform actions on user accounts. To enable user authentication for Private Access and Internet Access, you must configure SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) for your IAM system. Note Zero Trust Secure Access only supports SSO for one IAM system at a time. Internet Access also supports NTLM v2-based SSO for your on-premises Active Directory. To ensure web access from public or home networks for users without the Secure Access Module, you must verify your authentication domain in Domain Verification.",
