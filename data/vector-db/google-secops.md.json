Trend Vision One pushes alerts, event data, container vulnerabilities, activity data, and audit logs to AWS S3 buckets managed by Trend Micro. Google SecOps retrieves this data using data feeds approximately every 15 minutes. Unretrieved data in the S3 buckets is retained for 7 days before being purged. You can create multiple feeds in Google SecOps and configure the data obtained using the feeds individually. Important The following instructions and screen captures were valid as of April 7, 2024. For further help, check your Google SecOps documentation. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, generate the access key and specify the data to send to Google SecOps.",

Under Data transfer, enable the toggle next to the data you want to send to S3 buckets. Note Sending activity data to an S3 bucket requires Trend Vision One credits. Configure the data allowance for transferring activity data and manage credit allocation in the Credits & Billing app. For information on the data format and requirements, see Data specification for AWS S3 buckets. Important Data in S3 buckets is retained for 7 days before being purged. Ensure your Google SecOps feeds are properly configured to ingest data from Trend Vision One. Whenever a data transfer is enabled, an S3 URI is generated and the data begins to be sent to the corresponding S3 bucket. Copy and store the S3 URI in a safe location.",
