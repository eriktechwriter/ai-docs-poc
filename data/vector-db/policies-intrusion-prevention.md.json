Important Policies, Threat Prevention, and the Intrusion Prevention module are \"Pre-release\" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-Release Disclaimer before using the feature. These features are not available in all regions. Certain settings in Intrusion Prevention require allocating additional credits when the policy is applied to your endpoints. Trend Micro periodically releases new Intrusion Prevention rules. New rules might appear on the console before your agents update the new ruleset automatically. You can manually force agents to update the rules by making changes to the policy configuration. Intrusion Prevention uses IP lists for configuring IP address exclusions. Configure IP lists in policy resources before configuring Intrusion Prevention.",
