Pay-as-you-go enables you to use Trend Vision One features without needing to estimate your usage in advance or modify your credit allocation later. Based on the rates in your pay-as-you-go contract, you are only billed for the amount that you use. Start using pay-as-you-go in three simple steps. Step 1: Purchase a pay-as-you-go contract On the Pay-as-you-go tab, click Purchase a contract in AWS to purchase a pay-as-you-go contract from AWS Marketplace. For more information, see Purchase a pay-as-you-go contract from AWS Marketplace. Step 2: Activate your contract Click the link in your activation email and follow the instructions to activate your pay-as-you-go contract. Your contract might take some time to activate.",
