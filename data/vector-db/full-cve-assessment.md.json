Note This feature is not available in all regions. Cyber Risk Exposure Management prioritizes assessment for high-impact and medium-impact vulnerabilities (CVEs with an impact score range of 31-100). The strategy helps you focus on the most important remediation tasks to stop potential threat actors from breaching your network. However, visibility into low-impact CVEs (CVEs with an impact score range of 0-30) may also be necessary for your organization to meet compliance requirements or follow internal policies. Additionally low-impact vulnerabilities may pose high future risks if new exploit methods emerge.",

If you do not have a third-party vulnerability assessment tool connected to Trend Vision One, you may configure the Trend Vision One vulnerability assessment service to assess your internal assets for all CVEs, including low-impact CVEs. In the Vulnerabilities tab of Cyber Risk Overview → Exposure Overview or the Risk Factors tab in Threat and Exposure Management → Vulnerabilities, click Configure CVE Coverage. You may choose to assess your internal assets for all CVEs or keep the default behavior of scanning for high-impact and medium-impact CVEs only. To understand how impact scores are determined, see CVE impact score. Note It may take up to 24 hours for new CVE data to display after enabling assessment for all CVEs on internal assets.",
