Connected Agentic SIEM & XDR data sources supply data used for analysis, threat hunting, and event correlation. Data is retained using analytic retention by default, which allows for more frequent data queries. Archival retention, used to retain data for compliance purposes or infrequent queries, is only available if you collect the data using a log repository. Trend Vision One retains Agentic SIEM & XDR-related data for a set predefined or custom retention period.",

When you extend the data retention period, the retained data includes: Activity logs Detection logs Events in Observed Attack Techniques Data from Workbench has a fixed retention period of 180 days, but you may extend the retention period if needed by contacting your support provider. To extend data retention, you can allocate credits to Agentic SIEM and select retention periods for individual data sources in Data Source and Log Management → Data sources and retention → Agentic SIEM & XDR. Data for most data sources can be retained for up to two years. You can only change the retention period for a data source once per day.",
