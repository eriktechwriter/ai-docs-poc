Follow the instructions below to migrate agents from your Apex One server to Standard Endpoint Protection.

If you need to move agents from Trend Vision One, you must use the IPXfer tool. Agents inherit the settings of the target server. Procedure Obtain the Apex One Settings Export Tool on the Apex One server host machine and export Apex One Security Agent policies to Standard Endpoint Protection. In the Trend Vision One console, go to Endpoint Security → Standard Endpoint Protection and click Directories → Product Servers.",
