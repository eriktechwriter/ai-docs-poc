In addition, you can now manually trigger a recalculation of the Risk Index and check for new risk events. Risk events for six of the eight risk factors can now be marked as one of the four following statuses: New In progress Remediated Dismissed Remediated and dismissed risk events no longer contribute to your Risk Index. When changing the status of risk events, you can select from three levels of scope: the selected risk event, all instances of the risk event for the selected assets, or all instances of the risk event for all assets.",

XDR detection-related risk events that have an associated workbench alert must still be managed via the Workbench app. Development is ongoing to support the new risk event management framework for vulnerability-related risk events. In addition, a subsequent release will allow you to accept risk events, meaning they will still contribute to your Risk Index, but will not be displayed in Risk Reduction Measures.
