Trend Vision One needs to verify your email domain to confirm that you have adequate permission to send phishing simulations to employees in your organization. This security precaution prevents bad actors from impersonating members of your organization. Unverified users can only send phishing simulation emails to a maximum of five recipients. You may complete the domain verification process by going to Administration → Domain Verification. To learn more, see Adding and managing domains. If you do not have access to the Domain Verification screen, you may verify your domain with a TXT record by following the procedure below. Procedure Copy your unique domain TXT record. Note Every Trend Vision One user is assigned a unique TXT key.",
