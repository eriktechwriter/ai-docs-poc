In turn, the July 2022 version of the Azure Well-Architected Framework will no longer be available in Cloud Security Posture from June 1, 2024. The removed version will no longer be accessible in filters, preventing the creation of new reports or report configurations with the outdated standard. This means that you will no longer be able to generate new PDF or CSV reports using report configurations that include the outdated compliance standard. However, any PDF or CSV reports already created remain available for download.",
