Important This is a \"Pre-release\" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-release disclaimer before using the feature. Note AI service access rules take priority over internet access rules. Procedure On the Secure Access Rules screen, click the AI Service Access tab and then click Create AI Service Access Rule. The rule configuration screen appears with the AI service access rule template selected. Specify a unique name and a description for the rule. Specify whether the applicable generative AI service is a public or private generative AI service. (Optional) To enable or disable the rule, click the toggle next to Status. Tip You can also enable or disable rules on the Secure Access Rules screen.",
