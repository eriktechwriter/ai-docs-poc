Do fixed agent versions update if the current version is no longer available or reaches end of support? Why is my Protection Manager not on the enrollment list? When using the Protection Manager enrollment you might find that some of your Protection Managers are not listed. This can be due to a couple of reasons: You created a new Protection Manager Instance after the release of Version Control Policies. Newly created Protection Managers are not included on the enrollment list. If you want to unenroll a newly created Protection Manager, please contact your support provider.",

When updating to Server & Workload Protection, your Trend Cloud One instance generates three API keys to interface with Trend Vision One.

You can verify the API keys in your Trend Cloud One console by going to Administration → API Keys. If one or more API keys are missing, please contact your support provider.

Do fixed agent versions update if the current version is no longer available or reaches end of support? If you have selected the Fixed Version policy for your endpoint agents, the agents only update to the selected version and no later. The assigned agents maintain the following behaviors: The fixed version policy applies even if the selected version is no longer available in Version Control Policies. If the selected agent version package has reached End of Support (EoS), agents maintain the policy and do not update beyond the selected version. However, agents using earlier versions might not be able to update to the selected version. If an endpoint has installed a newer agent version than the selected version, the agent stays on that version. The agent does not update to newer versions and does not revert to the selected version.",
