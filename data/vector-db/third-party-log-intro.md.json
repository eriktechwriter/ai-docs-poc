Third-Party Log Collection is a log management system that allows you to ingest and retain log data from your organization's third-party data sources. Ingested data gives you actionable data visibility for threat detection and correlation in Agentic SIEM plus support for compliance audits and regulatory data management. Set specific ingestion and retention types for each log repository to more efficiently organize collected log data and access the data when needed in Trend Vision One solutions.",
