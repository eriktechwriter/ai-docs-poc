The status of a Service Gateway Virtual Appliance must be healthy in order for an upgrade to the latest version to proceed. If your Service Gateway 1.0 status is unhealthy, you may migrate directly to Service Gateway 3.0. Note To minimize disruption of services during migration, do not change the Service Gateway Management API key before migrating the Service Gateway virtual appliance. The source (1.0) and target (3.0) appliances may be temporarily unavailable during migration. Procedure Deploy a new Service Gateway 3.0 appliance to replace your existing 1.0 appliance. Go to Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management. Click Download Virtual Appliance.",
