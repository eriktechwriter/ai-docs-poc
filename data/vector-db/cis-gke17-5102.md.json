Alpha clusters are designed for early adopters to experiment with workloads that take advantage of new features before those features are production-ready. They have all Kubernetes API features enabled, but are not covered by the GKE SLA, do not receive security updates, have node auto-upgrade and node auto-repair disabled, and cannot be upgraded. They are also automatically deleted after 30 days. Note By default, Kubernetes Alpha features are disabled. Impact Users and workloads will not be able to take advantage of features included within Alpha clusters.",
