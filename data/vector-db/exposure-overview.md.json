Exposure Overview displays your company's average exposure risk level and corresponding risk score for the category over the last 30 days. The exposure score is calculated using the weight of each exposure-related risk factor and the corresponding risk events in your environment along with the potential impact if the detected issues are exploited. Time-critical vulnerabilities are given greater weight in the calculation. Important The exposure risk level is calculated using all data received from your business without applying asset visibility scope limits.",
