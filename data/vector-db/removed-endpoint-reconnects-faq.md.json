The behavior of removing and reconnecting depends on when the endpoint was removed.\n\nFor endpoints removed before March 25, 2024:\n\n- After removal, Endpoint Inventory creates a command to disable the endpoint sensor.\n\n- The next time the endpoint powers on, it receives the disable command and removes the endpoint sensor.\n\n- The endpoint does not reappear in Endpoint Inventory. To reconnect and enable the sensor, you must [download and reinstall the agent package](deploy-agents.md).\n\nFor endpoints removed after March 25, 2024:\n\n- After removal, Endpoint Inventory creates a command to disable the endpoint sensor.\n\n- Additionally, Endpoint Inventory creates a reconnect request. The reconnect request expires after 365 days.",
