If your Virtual Network Sensor loses connection to Trend Vision One, reconnect as soon as possible to avoid having to redeploy the sensor. How to fix a failure to register? If your Virtual Network Sensor fails to register with Trend Vision One, use the following steps to verify your connection and try again. Use an endpoint on the same network as the Virtual Network Sensor to verify you are able to establish a connection with Trend Vision One services. Use the command curl -v with the FQDN list in the firewall requirements for Trend Vision One to check if you can connect to the required services. If the connection fails, check your firewall settings. If you are in the Americas region, an example test command is curl -v xlogr-ue1.xdr.trendmicro.com Download and redeploy the installer package.",
