Phishing simulations are tests your organization can carry out to determine your employees' cybersecurity awareness level. A phishing simulation campaign allows you to control the duration of the simulation, monitor results, and determine next steps for employees who failed the simulation. Important Phishing simulations are limited to 12 per year with a maximum of 200 recipients per simulation unless you upgrade your pricing package to Cyber Risk Exposure Management - Essentials. After upgrading, there is no limit to the number of simulations you can run, and the maximum number of recipients per simulation is 180,000. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, go to Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Security Awareness → Phishing Simulations.",
