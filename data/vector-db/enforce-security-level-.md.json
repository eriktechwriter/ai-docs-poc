For example, if you set the security level to low, Server & Workload Protection will only block URLs that are known to be web threats. As you set the security level higher, the web threat detection rate improves but the possibility of false positives also increases. Use the following steps to configure the security level settings. Procedure Go to Policies. Double-click the policy that you want to edit. Click Web Reputation → General.",
