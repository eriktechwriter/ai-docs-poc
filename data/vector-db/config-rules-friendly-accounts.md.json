A Friendly account is the one that is allowed to access resources on another account because it is trusted. Once a Friendly account is added to the relevant rules, it will result in a success check after a Cloud Risk Management Scan scan. Account Administrators explicitly allow specific actions or behaviours for friendly accounts. These accounts may have access to a limited set of functionality deemed safe by the administrator. For example: AWS Account A has access to resources in AWS Account B. Both accounts may or may not be owned by the same company or Account A might just \"trust\" the Account B from AWS console. In this case, Account B would be a friendly (trusted) account to Account A as determined by the customer. Therefore certain rule failures caused by Account B are excluded from the check.",
