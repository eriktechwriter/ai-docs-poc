The File Security Virtual Appliance acts a local scanner on your on-premises servers or your AWS EC2 instances behind your firewall. Your files never leave your system; only metadata is returned to Trend Micro. You can add the Virtual Appliance from either the Trend Vision One Service Gateway app or Trend Vision One File Security. After deploying the File Security Virtual Appliance into a corporate data center or private cloud environment, you add mount points to your servers using the File Security UI console and have target files on storage servers scanned automatically. Alternatively, you can adopt the File Security SDK to send file metadata to the File Security Virtual Appliance for scanning.",

    "content": "In both scenarios, no files leave your corporate boundary. Virtual appliances can have multiple servers, and servers can have multiple mount points. You enable scanning on the mount points. When you enable scanning for a mount point, it scans all of the files in the selected folder. It continues to monitor the folder and scans any files that are added to, or modified in, the folder. When you add your mount points, you have the option of enabling Predictive Machine Learning and suspicious file quarantining.
