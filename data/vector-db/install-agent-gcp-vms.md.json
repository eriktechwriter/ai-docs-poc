Option 2: Manually install and activate the agent You only need to deploy a few agents. Obtain the agent software, copy it to the GCPVM, and then install it. For details, see Get agent software. Activate the agent. You can do so on the agent or on the Server & Workload Protection console. For details, see Activate the agent. Verify that the agent was installed and activated properly: Log in to the Server & Workload Protection console. Click Computers at the top. On the navigation pane on the left, make sure your GCP VM appears under Computers → your_GCP_service_account → your_GCP_project. In the main pane, make sure your GCP VMs appear with a Status of Managed (Online) and a green dot next to them. Assign a policy if you installed and activated the agent manually.",
