A cousin domain (or look-alike domain) is a domain that looks deceptively similar to a legitimate target domain, which is well-known or familiar to users. Cousin domains are often used in phishing attacks to steal sensitive or confidential information from users. Cousin domains are usually created by replacing one or more characters (for example, replacing the letter \"l\" with the number \"1\") or adding or removing an extra character in the domain name.",

By leveraging the Trend Micro Antispam Engine, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection can scan domains in email messages (the from and replyto headers) to detect cousin domains of these high-profile domains you have configured and prevent users from spam, phishing and BEC messages. Note High Profile Domains apply to Exchange Online and Gmail only. Procedure In Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, go to Policies → Global Settings → User-Defined Lists → High Profile List and click High Profile Domains. Add one or more legitimate sender domains. Type a domain name, for example, domain.com. Wildcard characters and regular expressions are not supported. Click Add. You can add up to 100 domains. To delete a domain, select the entry and click Delete.",
