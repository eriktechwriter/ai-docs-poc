Disabling packet capture does not require a restart.\n:::\n\nTo enable and configure your packet capture rules, see [Configuring Packet Capture](configuring-packet-capture.md).\n\n**Related information**\n\n- [Configuring Packet Capture](configuring-packet-capture.md \"Enable and configure packet capture rules.\")",
