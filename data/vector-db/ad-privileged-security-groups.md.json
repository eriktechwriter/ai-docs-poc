Certain default security groups in Active Directory (on-premises) that are created when the domain is created grant privileged status by default. Membership in privileged security groups can be used to control access to shared resources and delegate administrative roles. You should investigate privileged identities that do not require privileged status to see if the identities are part of privileged groups. If possible, remove these identities from the groups to strengthen your organization's identity posture. The following table details default security groups that grant privileged status.",
