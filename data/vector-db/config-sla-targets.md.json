Set clear expectations for case handling, receive timely notifications before an SLA breach, and ensure consistent service quality across the incident response process. SLA metrics include the following: Time to acknowledge (TTA): How long it takes to open a new case and change its status to In progress for the first time after creation of the Workbench alert or insight. Time to close (TTC): How long it takes to change the case status to Closed after creation of the case. Time to respond (TTR): How long it takes to manually perform the last response action, or run a security playbook, after creation of the Workbench alert or insight.",
