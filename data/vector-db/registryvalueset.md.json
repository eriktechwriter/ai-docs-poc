This is a hierarchical pattern, with sections of the pattern separated by \"/\" matched against sections of the key path separated by \"\" Default Value Each registry key has an unnamed or default value. This value can be explicitly specified for inclusion and exclusion by using a trailing \"/\" in patterns. For example, **/ will match all subordinate unnamed values, and \"*Agent/**/\" will match all unnamed values below a key matching \"*Agent\". Note Registry value names can contain any printable character, including quotes, backslash, the \"@\" symbol, etc. The Agent deals with this in Entity key names by using backslash as an escape character, but only backslashes themselves are escaped.",
