ICAP allows proxy servers to offload specific content processing tasks to dedicated servers, creating a more efficient division of labor. Standardized in RFC 3507, ICAP operates on port 1344 by default and follows a client-server model where ICAP clients send content to ICAP servers for processing. Containerized Scanner with ICAP Server The Vision One File Security containerized scanner implements an ICAP server that receives files from ICAP clients, scans them for malware and other threats, and returns the scan results. This solution can be deployed in Kubernetes environments using Helm charts, making it flexible for both cloud and on-premises deployments.",
