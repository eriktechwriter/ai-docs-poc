If you think that the system-defined criticality is inaccurate or does not match the actual situation, you can manually assign a custom criticality to assets. In Attack Surface Discovery asset profiles and asset cards, you can now click Modify Criticality to select a custom criticality. You can also revert to using the system-defined criticality at any time. Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
