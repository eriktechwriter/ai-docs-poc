Before you begin To add a collector to a log repository, you must have at least one deployed Service Gateway with the Third-Party Log Collection service installed. To learn how to deploy a Service Gateway, see the Service Gateway deployment guides. Procedure In Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration → Third-Party Log Collection or Service Management → Data Source and Log Management → Third-party log repositories, create a new log repository or select an existing log repository. Go to the Collectors tab and click Add Collector.The Add Collector screen appears. Begin typing the name of the third-party data source vendor you wish to use (example: Fortinet). If the vendor is not on the list, click Create to use the specified vendor name.",
