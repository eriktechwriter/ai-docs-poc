Unsupported versions use the default level of 2 - Moderate and cannot be changed. Support for Linux agents is limited to 64-bit (x86-64) and 32-bit (x86) systems. Agents deployed to other Linux architectures use the default level of 2 - Moderate and cannot be changed. The Anti-Malware Monitoring Level setting allows you to set the sensitivity of the anti-malware scan and the strictness applied when responding to potential threats. Higher levels allow for more strict monitoring to help with situations like on-going threat investigations, but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance.",

    "content": "Because of the potential impact on endpoint performance and the generation of additional detection logs, Trend Micro recommends using the default setting of 2 - Moderate. Only use the higher levels if you are investigating an on-going threat, or if instructed by your support provider. Tip If you want Anti-Malware Scan and Behavior Monitoring to exclude certain detection rules, you can add the rule ID to the Rule Exceptions list by going to the Anti-Malware → Advanced tab of the Computer or Policy editor. You can find rule IDs by viewing events in Events & Reports. For more information, see Create Anti-Malware exceptions. Procedure Open the properties of the malware scan configuration. On the General tab, under Anti-Malware Monitoring Level, configure the settings for Detection level and Prevention level. Important The Prevention level must be the same or lower than Detection level. Click OK. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base",
