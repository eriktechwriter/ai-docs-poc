Important If you are working on a policy, make sure to save your settings before leaving the screen. Leaving the screen without saving discards any changes. Trend Micro preset rules cannot be deleted or modified. You can duplicate preset rules to create a new firewall rule. Firewall rules are a policy resource you can configure to manage how Firewall handles specific connection types, usually to override the basic Firewall settings. Firewall rules can allow, block, and log internet connections. For example, if your Firewall is configured to block all traffic, you can use a Firewall rule to allow trusted traffic to bypass the Firewall. You can add up to 300 firewall rules. Procedure Go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Policy Resources → Firewall Rules. Create or edit a rule.",
