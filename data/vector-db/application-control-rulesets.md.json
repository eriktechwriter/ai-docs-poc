You can: View Application Control software rulesets and find out which rules they include. Tip When you first enable Application Control for a computer, the software installed on the computer is added to the computer's inventory and allowed to run. However, you cannot see the rules associated with the inventory from Server & Workload Protection unless you use the Deep Security legacy REST API to do so (see Use the API to access advanced Application Control features). In the Server & Workload Protection console, a computer's ruleset appears empty until you create some allow/block rules for the computer. Change the action of one Application Control software ruleset rule if a software file should no longer be allowed/blocked.",

If you delete a rule, Application Control will not recognize the software anymore. If the software is installed again, it will appear again on the Actions tab. If a software update is unstable and you might need to downgrade, keep rules that allow rollback to the previous software version until you have completed testing.",
