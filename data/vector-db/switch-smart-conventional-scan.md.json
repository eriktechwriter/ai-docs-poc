Considerations When Switching to Conventional Scan Consideration Details Number of Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents to switch Switching a relatively small number of Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents at a time allows efficient use of the Apex One (Mac) server and Smart Protection Server resources. These servers can perform other critical tasks while Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents change their scan methods. Timing When switching back to conventional scan, Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents will likely download the full version of the Virus Pattern and Spyware-active Monitoring Pattern from the Apex One (Mac) server. These pattern files are only used by conventional scan agents.",
