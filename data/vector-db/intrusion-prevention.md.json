When patches are not available for known vulnerabilities in applications or operating systems, Intrusion Prevention rules can intercept traffic that is trying to exploit the vulnerability. It identifies malicious software that is accessing the network and it increases visibility into, or control over, applications that are accessing the network. Therefore your computers are protected until patches that fix the vulnerability are released, tested, and deployed. Protection is available for file sharing and messaging software such as Skype, but also web applications with vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).",

Note For a list of operating systems where Intrusion Prevention is supported, see Supported features by platform. Intrusion Prevention rules Intrusion Prevention rules define a set of conditions that are compared to the payload session and application layers of network packets (such as DNS, HTTP, SSL, and SMTP), as well as the sequence of those packets according to those higher-layer protocols. Tip Firewall rules examine the network and transport layers of a packet (IP, TCP, and UDP, for example). When agents scan network traffic and the traffic meets a rule's match conditions, the agent handles it as a possible or confirmed attack and performs one of the following actions, depending on the rule: Completely drop packets Reset the connection Intrusion Prevention rules are assigned to policies and computers.",

Selecting Detect mode at the computer or policy level enforces Detect mode behavior regardless of rule settings. Some rules issued by Trend Micro use Detect mode by default.
