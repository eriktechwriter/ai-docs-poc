Custom reports allow you to include data from various Trend Vision One apps into a single report. To quickly create a report that includes data from a single app, you can create a report using a template. Note The availability of certain report templates and data sources depends on your license entitlement for the associated app or service. For more information, see Reports license requirements. Procedure Go to Dashboards and Reports → Reports. To configure a new report, go to the Report Templates tab and click Create custom report. To edit a scheduled report, go to the Scheduled Report Settings tab and click the name of the custom report you want to edit. (Proceed to step three.) Configure the report data. Select the report content you want to display in the report.",
