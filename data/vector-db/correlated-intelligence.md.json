Designed to empower you with enhanced detection capabilities, Correlated Intelligence correlates suspicious signals from various sources to detect security risks and anomalies. Note Correlated Intelligence is available for Exchange Online, Exchange Online (Inline Mode), Gmail, and Gmail (Inline Mode). Currently, Correlated Intelligence collects signals from Advance Spam Protection, Malware Scanning, and Web Reputation. One key advantage of Correlated Intelligence is its capability to see and analyze signals from multiple sources to identify security risks that may go unnoticed by a single security filter. This multi-source approach adds an extra layer of protection to detect potential threats.",

Anomalies may not necessarily indicate a security risk, but are unusual enough to warrant attention. With this feature, you can have a more comprehensive view of your security landscape. Correlated Intelligence operates by first gathering signals from various security filters and then matching the signals against the predefined or user-defined rules. The aim of this process is to identify any matches that could indicate a security risk or anomaly, providing a more thorough and nuanced analysis of potential security threats. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection comes with a set of predefined correlation rules and detection signals to detect Trend Micro specified security risks and anomalies.",
