Note Trend Vision One automatically creates a default private access rule to apply whenever no other private access rules are matched. The default rule blocks all access to configured internal apps. Procedure On the Secure Access Rules screen, click the Private Access tab and then click Create Rule. The rule configuration screen appears with the Internal app access rule template selected. Specify a unique name and a description for the rule. (Optional) To enable or disable the rule, click the toggle next to Status. Tip You can also enable or disable rules on the Secure Access Rules screen. Configure the following rule settings.",
