Systems that use MFA grant access to data and applications only after users present two or more credentials. Commonly used credentials include passwords, PINs, tokens, and fingerprints. MFA is effective because threat actors that are able to compromise system passwords are unlikely to meet the second authentication requirement. Note Cyber Risk Exposure Management only detects this issue for Microsoft Entra ID. Active Directory does not have built-in MFA capability. You can remediate the issue through the following methods: System Steps Active Directory Integrate third-party tools such as Cisco Duo and Google Authenticator that can confirm user identities and provide secure access to data and applications.",
