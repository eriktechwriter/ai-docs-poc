Campaigns Trend Micro threat researchers monitor and analyze attack campaigns affecting organizations around the world. Their research provides context to detected attack indicators and allows Trend Vision One to predict possible next steps by attackers. Use the information to identify other potentially compromised assets and mitigate the risk posed by each campaign. Campaign tags indicate regions, platforms, and industries the campaign affects the most. A red circle next to the campaign name indicates the app found attack indicators of that campaign in your environment. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base",
