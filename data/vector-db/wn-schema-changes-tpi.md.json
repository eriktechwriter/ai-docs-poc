These changes are designed to facilitate Splunk in capturing event time from container vulnerability logs by placing the event time fields at the beginning of the logs. Users who have enabled container vulnerability logs in their AWS S3 Bucket connector may also be impacted by these changes. For more information, see Schema changes for Container Vulnerability logs in AWS S3 and Splunk HEC Connectors in Trend Vision One.
