Considerations When Switching to Smart Scan Consideration Details Product license Ensure that you have activated all required licenses for the new scan method. Apex One server Ensure that agents can connect to the Apex One server. Apex One only notifies online agents to switch scan methods. Offline agents get notified when they become online. Independent agents are notified when they become online or, if the agent has scheduled update privileges, when scheduled update runs. Also verify that the Apex One server has the latest components to ensure that Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents can download the correct patterns from the server.",

These servers can perform other critical tasks while Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents change scan methods. Timing When switching scan methods, Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents need to download full versions of the required pattern files for the new scan method. Consider switching during off-peak hours to minimize the impact to network bandwidth and interruption to end user daily operations. Trend Micro recommends disabling \"Update Now\" on Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents during the conversion process.
