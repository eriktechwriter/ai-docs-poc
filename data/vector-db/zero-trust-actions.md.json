You can take specific actions on users, endpoints, or their app/URL access activity manually or automatically based on risk status. After triggering an action, the Zero Trust Secure Access app creates a task and sends the command to the respective enforcement point. Note Actions taken manually take precedence over the automated control configured in secure access rules. The following tables describe the actions you can take on users, endpoints, internal apps, and cloud apps/URLs found in your environment for risk remediation. User Action Description Disable User Account Signs the user out of all active application and browser sessions of the user account. This task might take a few minutes to complete. Users are prevented from signing in any new session.",
