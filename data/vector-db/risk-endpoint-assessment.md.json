Scanning as many endpoints as possible helps expand your view of the attack surface and find threats that might have evaded your existing security solutions. Select the endpoints to assess by clicking Select Endpoints From Inventory, and then click Run Assessment tool. You can select a maximum of 1,000 endpoints at a time. Important In order for the tool to automatically scan and upload data back to the Cyber Risk Assessment app, make sure that the endpoints are online and allowed to connect to Trend Vision One. Wait until all your endpoints finish the assessment. You will receive an email notification when the assessment is complete. Click the link in the notification to access the Trend Vision One console, and click View Report in the At-Risk Endpoint Assessment area.",
