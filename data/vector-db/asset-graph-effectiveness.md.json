The asset graph now includes a symbol for the internet, helping you easily identify which assets are exposed to the internet. The asset detail screen for domains and IP addresses now also features an asset graph illustrating the relationships between internet-facing assets and other types of assets. The asset graph helps you better understand how domains and IP addresses are associated with internet-exposed devices. In addition, the asset graph now shows relationships associated with privileges, including user and group memberships, as well as how roles are assigned, to whom a role is assigned, and administrative devices and users.",
