The one-hour time span is not configurable. The alert is sent via email when the alert is raised by default. If you are receiving too many of these email alerts because one hour is not long enough to disperse the updates, you can disable email notifications for this alert. Instead, you can receive email messages for the \"Computer Not Receiving Updates\" alert for which you can configure the time that passes before the alert is raised. Procedure To ensure that the agent is configured to automatically download component updates, in Server & Workload Protection, click Administration → Scheduled Tasks.",
