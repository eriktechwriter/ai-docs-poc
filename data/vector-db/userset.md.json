To enable and configure Integrity Monitoring, see Set up integrity monitoring. The UserSet element represents a set of users. On a Windows system it operates on users local to the system - the same users displayed by the \"Local Users and Groups\" MMC snap-in. Note that these are local users only if the agent is running on something other than a domain controller. On a domain controller, a UserSet element will enumerate all of the domain users, which may not be advisable for extremely large domains. On Unix systems, the users monitored are whatever the \"getpwent_r()\" and \"getspnam_r()\" APIs have been configured to return.",
