Trend Micro recommends creating a dedicated account each user and another for Server & Workload Protection itself. That is, users should each have one account to access and control the virtual machines themselves and a separate account for Server & Workload Protection to connect to those resources. Note Having a dedicated account for Server & Workload Protection ensures that you can refine the rights and revoke this account at any time. It is recommended to give Server & Workload Protection an access key or secret key with read-only rights at all times. Note Server & Workload Protection only requires read-only access to import the cloud resources and mange their security.",

For example, if you delete a number of instances from vSphere, those instances disappear automatically from the Server & Workload Protection console. By contrast, if you use Computers → Add Computer, cloud instances that are deleted from vCenter remain visible in the Server & Workload Protection console until they are manually deleted. Cloud resources are organized into their own branch in the Server & Workload Protection console, which lets you easily see which resources are protected and which are not.",
