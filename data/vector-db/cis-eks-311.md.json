The kubelet kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. It is possible to run kubelet with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file. Note See the AWS EKS documentation for the default value. Audit Method 1 SSH to the worker nodes.",
