You can manage your Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection groups using the Endpoint Inventory screen. Note Endpoints which have deployed Endpoint Sensor only and are not managed by a Protection Manager cannot be added to groups. You can use the Add filters () button and search field to locate endpoints by parameters such as agent policy, device type, operating system, and more. Procedure For Standard Endpoint Protection agents: Go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Inventory. In the Endpoint Management section to the left of the list, expand your Standard Endpoint Protection Management instance.",
