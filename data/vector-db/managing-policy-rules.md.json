At any time, administrators can see the policy rules that apply to their organizations, and make changes to the policy rules that comprise their policy, rename the policy rules, query the policy rules, reorder the policy rules, and create new policy rules. Each policy rule can be disabled if desired without losing its definition, and re-enabled at a later time. Policy Rule Tasks Task Step Adding Policy Rules Tip A new policy rule may be similar to the one you already have. In this case, it is easier to copy the policy rule and edit it rather than create a new policy rule from scratch. Click Add. Define the basic information about the policy rule (rule name, whether it is enabled or not, and notes about the rule). See Naming and enabling a policy rule.",
