Trend Micro Apex Central provides several widgets that highlight threat events for important users and endpoints. You may want to apply stricter policies to important users or endpoints and constantly monitor their protection status. You must first assign custom tags, or create custom filters, to identify the important users or endpoints. After identifying the important users or endpoints on your network, you can assign the important tag to provide greater visibility on the Dashboard. For more information see Custom Tags and Filters. Note Manually assign importance to users/endpoints grouped using custom tags and filters.",

For example, if the an endpoint is removed from a custom filter on the User/Endpoint Directory screen, then log queries and generated reports that use the filter will exclude data from the removed endpoint.
