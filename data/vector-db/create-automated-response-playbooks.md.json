Automated Response Playbooks (formerly Automated Response) allow you to automate your response to Workbench alerts by leveraging the Security Playbooks app. When a detection model triggers an alert on highly suspicious or suspicious objects, the Automated Response Playbook can create response tasks and compile the results into a report sent to your security team. The Automatic Investigation and Response system leverages Trend Micro Threat Intelligence powered by Trend Micro Smart Protection Network to reassess highlighted objects found in Workbench alerts, such as files, URLs, IP addresses, and domains. The analysis measures the likelihood of a false positive during the reassessment.",

Click the add node () below the Condition node and click Else-If Condition or Else Action. Configure a condition node by following Step 6, or configure an action node by following Step 7 or Step 8. Note The nodes that can be added by using an add node () vary depending on the preceding node. For example, an Action node can only be possibly followed by another Action node; a Condition node can be followed by an Action node or have an Else-If Condition or Else Action attached to it. When a condition is false, the playbook performs the Else Action or checks if its Else-If Condition is met. If the Else-If Condition is met, the playbook continues to perform the corresponding Else Action. Multiple Action nodes configured in a serial mode are taken sequentially. Enable the playbook by toggling the Enable control on. Click Save.",
