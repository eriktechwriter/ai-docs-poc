For example, the Describe a Policy operation of the policies endpoint returns a policy object for a specific policy on Server & Workload Protection. This endpoint defines an overrides parameter that determines which property values are returned for the targeted policy: overrides = false: The returned policy object includes the property values that are inherited from the parent policy, as well as the property values that the policy overrides. overrides = true: The returned policy object includes only the properties that the policy overrides.",

For example, you use the Create a Policy operation to create a policy that has the Base Policy as the parent, and turns on the Application Control module: overrides = false: The response includes a policy object that has all of the property values of the Base Policy policy, as well as the Application Control status value of on. overrides = true: The response includes a policy object that includes only the Application Control status value of on. For operations that search or list resources, the overrides parameter determines which resources are returned, as well as which property values are included.",
