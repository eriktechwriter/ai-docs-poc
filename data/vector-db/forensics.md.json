Forensics has no deployment steps and adds no operational complexity. From the Trend Vision One console, you can gather digital evidence from endpoints, organize the collected evidence data within workspaces, and triage endpoints using osquery and YARA. The following table outlines the sections available in Forensics (Agentic SIEM & XDR → Forensics).
