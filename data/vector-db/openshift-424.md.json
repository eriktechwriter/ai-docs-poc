The connections from the API server to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the API server does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the API server could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests. Note By default, the clientCAFile is set to /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt. Impact You require TLS to be configured on API server as well as kubelets.",

    "content": "Audit OpenShift provides integrated management of certificates for internal cluster components. OpenShift 4 includes multiple CAs providing independent chains of trust, which ensure that a platform CA will never accidentally sign a certificate that can be used for the wrong purpose, increasing the security posture of the cluster. You can verify the client CA file with the following command: for node in $(oc get nodes -ojsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do oc get --raw /api/v1/nodes/$node/proxy/configz | jq '.kubeletconfig.authentication.x509.clientCAFile' done Verify all the nodes are using /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt as the clientCAFile value. Remediation None. Changing the clientCAFile value is unsupported. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base",
