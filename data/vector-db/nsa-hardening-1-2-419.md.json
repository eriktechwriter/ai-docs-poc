AppArmor can be configured for any application to reduce its potential attack surface and provide greater in-depth defense. It is configured through profiles tuned to allow the access needed by a specific program or container, such as Linux capabilities, network access, and file permissions. Each profile can be run in either enforcing mode, which blocks access to disallowed resources, or complain mode, which only reports violations. AppArmor can help you to run a more secure deployment by restricting what containers are allowed to do, and/or provide better auditing through system logs.",

Audit Run the following command and review the details of each pod: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces For Kubernetes versions 1.30 and later: Review each pod’s securityContext and ensure it has appArmorProfile configured. For Kubernetes versions prior to 1.30: Review each pod’s containers' metadata annotations for container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/<container name> Ensure each container has AppArmor configured.
