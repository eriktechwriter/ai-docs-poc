Third-party intelligence is processed to produce custom intelligence reports after successful data retrieval. Trend Vision One triggers Auto Sweeping tasks at the same scheduled time every day and calculates the total number of indicators applied for Auto Sweeping over the past 24 hours to track quota usage. Note A maximum of 50,000 indicators is allowed per day for Auto Sweeping. The quota limit is shared by Auto Sweeping tasks triggered from both intelligence reports and third-party intelligence. If the total number of indicators reaches the daily quota limit for Auto Sweeping, you can trigger Manual Sweeping when necessary.",
