Note Only customers that have updated to the Foundation Services release have access to the feature. This feature is not available in all regions. Internet Access provides a default PAC file built in the Secure Access Module for HTTP/HTTPS traffic forwarding to the Internet Access Gateway. You can change the PAC file by individual endpoint, endpoint group, or operating system. Note For a single endpoint, the PAC file applied using the following steps takes effect, regardless of the platform-based PAC file configured for the endpoint. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, go to Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Secure Access Module. Filter out the desired endpoints by either security deployment type or endpoint group.",
