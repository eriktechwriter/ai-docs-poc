Evidence archives take up hard drive space which may impact endpoint performance. Click to download the Trend Micro Incident Response Toolkit. Deploy the toolkit to the endpoints on which you want to collect evidence. Execute the toolkit. Extract the contents of the .zip archive. Execute TMIRT.sh as the root user. If you do not have privileges for executing scripts, execute the following commands. Identify the endpoint operating system (OS) architecture by executing the uname -m command. For AArch64 or ARM64 architecture, use the TMIRT-arm64.tgz toolkit. For i386 or i686 architecture, use the TMIRT-x86.tgz toolkit. For AMD64 or x86_64 architecture, use the TMIRT-x64.tgz toolkit. To extract the toolkit from the .tgz file, execute the ./tar -xf command with the correct version of the Trend Micro Incident Response Toolkit based on your OS architecture.",
