However, you need to turn on scanning in each bucket to allow the scanner access to the files being uploaded to that bucket. When EventBridge is turned on, File Security can scan that bucket. File Security cannot scan a bucket when the Status is EventBridge off or the Scanner is not deployed. The first time you time deploy a File Security Storage stack, it, by default, monitors all the S3 buckets in which EventBridge is on. When you add or remove the monitoring buckets, File Security Storage stores the list of monitoring buckets in the config. File Security Storage scans buckets based on the config. (This behavior is for backward compatibility.",

    "content": "When you upgrade the old File Security Storage template (in which monitoring bucket is simply based on EventBridge on) to the enhanced version (in which monitoring buckets is based on customer’s choice in the console), you are protected without having to re-configure the monitoring bucket. Before stack version 1.2.0, you need to turn on or turn off EventBridge to control whether the scanning is enable or not. In stack versions 1.2.0 or greater, File Security Storage creates an S3 configuration bucket in your environment. it uses the information in this configuration bucket to determine whether to scan a specific bucket. Every time you turn on scanning, File Security Storage enables EventBridge. However, if you turn off scanning, File Security Storage does not disable EventBridge, but rather saves the current scanning status in the configuration bucket.",

If, however, you remove the existing stack and then re-install a new stack instead of updating the stack, File Security Storage considers this a new installation, and you lose the previous settings.
