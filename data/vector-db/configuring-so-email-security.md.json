Suspicious file SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes apply during virus scanning. You have enabled spam policies with Web Reputation turned on. Suspicious URLs apply during Web Reputation scanning. Procedure Go to Administration → Other Settings → Service Integration. Click Threat Intelligence. Enable Check for suspicious files and URLs. For files or URLs that match the suspicious objects from both Trend Vision One and Trend Micro Apex Central, the settings for the suspicious objects from Trend Vision One take precedence. Enable Check for suspicious sender addresses. Cloud Email Gateway Protection synchronizes only the sender addresses configured with the “Block/Quarantine” action in Trend Vision One and blocks messages from these senders.",
