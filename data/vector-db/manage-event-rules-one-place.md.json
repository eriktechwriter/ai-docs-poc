When you mark a risk event as Dismissed, an event rule is created to prevent Attack Surface Risk Management from reporting future instances of the risk event in Risk Reduction Measures and All Risk Events. The event rule also prevents the dismissed risk event from impacting your organization's Risk Index. Event Rule Management allows you to review and manage all dismissed event rules. If you remove a dismissed event rule, all new instances of the risk event are reported and contribute to your organization's Risk Index. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
