An unmanaged endpoint may still be connected to a Protection Manager or a managed by a connected endpoint security product, such as Trend Cloud One Workload Security.\n\nThe following are typical reasons why an endpoint listed in Endpoint Inventory may be considered unmanaged:\n\n- You recently updated a connected endpoint product to Server & Workload Protection and the connected endpoint agent software has not been updated.\n\n- You connected or deployed agent software using a method other than the installation package or script from Endpoint Inventory.",
