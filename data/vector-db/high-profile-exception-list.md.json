In most cases, BEC attacks tend to target business mailboxes, with the goal of initiating an unauthorized wire transfer. In addition, some applications with an email system may have the function of automatically sending system-generated messages in the name of a high profile user. To avoid these types of email messages from being classified as BEC attacks and help reduce false positives, specify the email addresses related to high profile users for which you want Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to skip the scanning for BEC.",
