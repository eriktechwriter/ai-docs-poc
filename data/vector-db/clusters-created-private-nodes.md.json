Private Nodes, which lack public IPs, limit node accessibility to internal networks only, thus requiring attackers to gain access to the local network before they can attempt to compromise the Kubernetes hosts. To implement Private Nodes effectively, the cluster must also be configured with a private master IP range and IP Aliasing. Note that Private Nodes do not inherently have outbound access to the public internet; to facilitate this, Cloud NAT can be used, or you can manage your own NAT gateway to provide outbound internet access for these nodes.",
