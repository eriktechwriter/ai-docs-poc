Procedure On the Detection Signals tab, click Add. Specify a name for the signal and optionally provide a description in the Basic Properties area. The name can help clearly identify what signals deviating from normal behaviors that you want to detect. In the Signal Definition area, define the signal. Select a condition field from the drop-down list. Select the desired operator from the drop-down list. Available operators include both integer value comparison operators and string value matching operators. For example, ≤ means that the condition field contains an integer that less than or equal to the specified integer value. Enter or select the desired value as a string or integer if necessary.",
