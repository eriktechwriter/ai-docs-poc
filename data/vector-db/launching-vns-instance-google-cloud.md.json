If your security environment uses a hybrid deployment, or you do not have VMware or Microsoft Hyper-V in your environment, you can leverage your Google Cloud projects to deploy a Virtual Network Sensor instance. Note The steps contained in these instructions are valid as of July 2024. Before you begin, make sure you have completed the following tasks: Choose or create a VPC and subnet for the Virtual Network Sensor management port. Choose or create a VPC and subnet for the Virtual Network Sensor data port. Trend Micro recommends assigning the Virtual Network Sensor data port to a different VPC than the mirror source VM. Important The Virtual Network Sensor data port and management port must be on separate VPCs. Assigning the ports to the same VPC causes deployment to fail.",
