Network Resources provides a set of lists you can use to define your network topography. Using these lists allows your connected appliances to better identify the source of threats and recognize which critical assets in your environment require additional monitoring. You can add network resources to each list, edit the lists, import files to configure each list, or export the lists to edit them. Note When you connect your Deep Discovery Inspector appliances to Network Inventory through Deep Discovery Director, Network Resources configurations are not available. Go to the Deep Discovery Director management console to configure the corresponding settings. You can create a Network Resource profile to define more than one set of lists.",
