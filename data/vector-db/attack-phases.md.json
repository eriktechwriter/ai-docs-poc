This section displays information about attacker activity for four phases that precede command-and-control communication. Find out if attackers are attempting to gain or maintain their foothold on your network, or if data theft or some form of system impact may soon occur. Click on the desktop or server icons on each phase to view endpoints affected during the attack phase. Attack Phase Description Initial Access An attacker has gained access or is attempting to gain access to your environment. If successful, attackers may attempt to move to the next attack phase. Persistence An attacker is attempting to maintain or increase access to your environment.",

Credential Access An attacker has obtained or is attempting to obtain account credentials within your environment. Data exfiltration or some form of system impact may occur soon. Attackers may attempt to interrupt, manipulate, steal, or destroy critical assets. Lateral Movement An attacker is expanding or attempting to expand the attack scope within your environment. Data exfiltration or some form of system impact may soon occur. Attackers may interrupt, manipulate, steal, or destroy your critical assets. Impact A targeted attack of high severity which reaches the final attack phase may cause significant damage within your environment.
