This is not a hierarchical Entity Set. Patterns are applied only to the group name. As a result the \"**\" pattern is not applicable. The following example monitors the \"Administrators\" group for additions and deletions. (The \"Member\" attribute is included implicitly because it is a part of the STANDARD set, and no attributes are explicitly listed.) <GroupSet> <include key=\"Administrators\" /> </GroupSet> Include and Exclude See Integrity monitoring rules language for a general description of Include and Exclude and their allowed attributes and sub elements.
