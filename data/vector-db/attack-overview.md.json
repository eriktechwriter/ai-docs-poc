Attack Overview displays your organization's risk level within the attack risk category, which is averaged from the daily attack intensity of all detected cyber threats in each attack phase. Factors considered when determining attack risk include: Number of known threat detections Number of impacted assets Severity of each unique threat type detected Daily attack scores are averaged from the maximum attack intensity of all detected cyber threats over the last 14 days. You can view your attack scores from the last 30 days on the attack overview trend graph. A high attack score indicates that you may need to review and reinforce your security configuration.",
