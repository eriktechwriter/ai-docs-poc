Procedure On the Configure Bandwidth Control screen, click Create Rule in the Bandwidth Control Rules area. In the Basic information section, configure basic rule information. Item Setting Rule name Specify a unique name for the bandwidth control rule. Description Meaningful description to easily identify the bandwidth control rule. Status Click the toggle to enable or disable the bandwidth control rule. The rule is enabled by default. If you no longer need a bandwidth control rule, delete it instead of disabling it. In the Source section, select the users/groups/private IP address groups and on-premises gateways that the bandwidth control rule applies to. Note Bandwidth control rules do not apply to on-premises gateways with ICAP enabled.",

This allows the transport channel to free up the required resources or pre-empt the resources from another transport channel with a lower service priority during exceptional network resource limitations, for example, network congestion.
