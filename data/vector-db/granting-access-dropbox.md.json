Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection generates a quarantine folder (trendmicro_cas_quarantine__dont_change_or_delete) and a temporary folder (trendmicro_cas_temp__dont_change_or_delete) in the Dropbox administrator's root directory. The quarantine folder can be accessed only by the administrator, while the temporary folder can be edited by all users. Note Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection renames the files in the quarantine folder. Each file is prefixed with RANDOM_UUID, which is a unique string randomly generated by Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection. For example, some_file.doc will be renamed ecdd6cc3-58d4-42a4-831a-e39bcbc1c8d5_some_file.doc. The temporary folder stores quarantined files before they are moved to the quarantine folder and restored files before they are moved back to their original locations.",
