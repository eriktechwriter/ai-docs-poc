If an error occurs during the log generation, you can manually collect all logs by logging on to the CLI with your account credentials on the Service Gateway virtual appliance and running the log collect command. Download the ZIP file by clicking the notification center icon in the upper-right corner and locating \"Successful log collection\" on the Tasks tab. If your support provider requests remote access to your Service Gateway virtual appliance to collect information, turn on Service Gateway Remote Support.
