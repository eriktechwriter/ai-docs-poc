This measure specifies a restricted range of IP addresses that are allowed to access your cluster’s control plane, which, in combination with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and authentication, secures access from the public internet. Although Kubernetes Engine provides the capability to manage your cluster from anywhere, you might opt to limit access further to specific IP addresses under your control.",

Care must be taken when setting up Endpoint Private Access to include all necessary IP addresses in the authorized list to avoid unintentionally blocking legitimate access to the cluster’s control plane. Impact When implementing Endpoint Private Access, ensure all required networks are included in the allowlist to avoid blocking access to your cluster's control plane. Audit Check the following settings to confirm they are 'enabled: true': export CLUSTER_NAME=<your cluster name> aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --query \"cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.endpointPublicAccess\" aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --query \"cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.endpointPrivateAccess\" Verify that the following is not null: export CLUSTER_NAME=<your cluster name> aws eks d",

This also allows you to restrict IP addresses that can access your API server from the internet or disable internet access entirely. For example, use the following command to enable private access and limited public access: aws eks update-cluster-config --region $AWS_REGION --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resources-vpc-config endpointPrivateAccess=true, endpointPublicAccess=true, publicAccessCidrs=\"203.0.113.5/32\" Note: CIDR blocks cannot include reserved addresses.
