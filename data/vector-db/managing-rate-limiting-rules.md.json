Rate limiting rules allow you to control the number of requests endpoints can make to your protected private generative AI service, helping to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Rate limiting rules can only be enforced by on-premises gateways operating in reverse proxy mode and deployed in front of a protected generative AI service. Procedure In Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration, click Manage Rate Limiting Rules. To create a new rate limiting rule, click Create Rule. Specify a name for the rule and an optional description. Choose whether to enable the rule after creation. Select the private IP address groups to target with the rule.",
