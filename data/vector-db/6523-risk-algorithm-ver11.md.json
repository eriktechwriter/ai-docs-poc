Cyber Risk Exposure Management calculates the risk score for each of your company's assets based on numerical values assigned to risk events occurring on the assets. Asset risk scores are then used to calculate the Cyber Risk Index. Risk events have the following values assigned to them: Likelihood: The probability that the risk will be exploited by an adversary Impact: Potential negative impact on business continuity if the risk is exploited Prior to the June 5, 2023 update, the likelihood value was calculated using a probability equation that gave equal weight to the three risk categories: Attack, Security Configuration, and Exposure.",

    "content": "This algorithm usually produced an accurate representation of asset risk, but ongoing testing conducted by Trend Micro threat experts determined that high-risk Attack events, such as security breaches and ransomware incidents, did not increase asset risk scores proportional to the critical nature of such events. In the new algorithm, the Exposure and Security Configuration risk levels are calculated separately from Attack, and the larger of the two results is used to determine likelihood. Following this algorithm update, the risk scores of assets affected by Attack events may have increased significantly, resulting in a sharp increase in the Cyber Risk Index. The updated asset risk and Cyber Risk Index scores are a more accurate representation of your company's attack surface risk. You can effectively reduce the Cyber Risk Index by prioritizing the mitigation of Attack risk events on affected assets. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base",
