The CVE impact score enables you to identify the CVEs in your environment with the biggest impact on your company's Cyber Risk Index. Cyber Risk Exposure Management calculates a different impact score for each affected asset as well as an impact score for the individual CVE. CVE impact scores are unique to your assets and environment. Scores are calculated based on affected asset criticality, impact scope, global exploit potential, and number of exploit attempts detected. CVE impact scores are organized into high, medium, and low impact.",
