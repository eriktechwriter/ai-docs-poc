As an administrator, you begin with one or more base policies from which you create multiple levels of child policies that get progressively more granular in their detail. You can assign broadly applicable rules and other configuration settings at the top-level policies and then get more targeted and specific as you go down through levels of child policies, eventually arriving at rule and configuration assignments at the individual computer level. As well as assigning more granular settings as you move down through the policy tree, you can also override settings from higher up the policy tree.",

    "content": "Server & Workload Protection provides a collection of policies that you can use as initial templates for the design of your own policies tailored to your environment: Inheritance Child policies inherit their settings from their parent policies. This allows you to create a policy tree that begins with a base parent policy configured with settings and rules that will apply to all computers. This parent policy can then have a set of child and further descendant policies which have progressively more specific targeted settings. Your policy trees can be built based on any kind of classification system that suits your environment. For example, the branches in the policy tree that comes with Server & Workload Protection has branches designed for specific operating systems. The Windows branch has further child policies for various sub-types of Windows operating systems.",

(The Windows policy setting would then read Inherited (On). The value in parentheses always shows you what the current inherited setting is.) Overrides The Overrides page shows you how many settings have been overridden at this policy or specific computer level. To undo the overrides at this level, click the Remove button. In this example, the Windows Server policy is a child policy of the Windows policy. Here, the anti-malware setting is no longer inherited; it is overridden and hard-set to On.",

Override object properties The intrusion prevention rules that are included in this policy are copies of the intrusion prevention rules stored by Server & Workload Protection, which are available for use by any other policies. If you want to change the properties of a particular rule, you have two choices: modify the properties of the rule globally so that the changes you make apply to all instances where the rule is in use, or modify the properties locally so that the changes you make only apply locally. The default editing mode in a Computer or policy editor is local. If you click Properties on the Assigned Intrusion Prevention Rules area toolbar, any changes you make in the Properties window that appears will only apply locally.",

Override rule assignments You can always assign additional rules at any policy or computer level. However, rules that are in effect at a particular policy or computer level because their assignment is inherited from a parent policy cannot be unassigned locally. They must be unassigned at the policy level where they were initially assigned.
