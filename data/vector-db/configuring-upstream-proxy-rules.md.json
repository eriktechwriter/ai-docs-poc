Before you begin Important To use the proxy settings of your Service Gateway for user web activity traffic, you must configure a proxy server for your Service Gateway virtual appliance via Service Gateway CLI commands. Ensure you have upgraded the Internet Access On-Premises Gateway service to the latest version. If enabled on an outdated on-premises gateway, only upstream proxy rules allowing direct traffic to destinations can function. All other traffic is sent directly to your Service Gateway virtual appliance. Configuring upstream proxy rules for your Internet Access On-Premises Gateway allows you to send user web activity traffic to specified domains, subdomains, and IP addresses via proxy.",
