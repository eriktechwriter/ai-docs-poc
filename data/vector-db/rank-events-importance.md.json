By assigning \"asset values\" to computers, and assigning severity or risk values to rules, the importance (\"rank\") of an event is calculated by multiplying the two values together. This allows you to sort events by rank. Note Unlike the other modules, Anti-Malware does not use asset values to rank event importance. Web Reputation event risk values Risk values for Web Reputation events are linked to the three levels of risk used by the Web Reputation settings on the General tab of the Web Reputation page: Dangerous: corresponds to \"A URL that has been confirmed as fraudulent or a known source of threats.\" Highly Suspicious: corresponds to \"A URL that is suspected to be fraudulent or a known source of threats.\" Suspicious: corresponds to \"A URL that is associated with spam or possibly compr",
