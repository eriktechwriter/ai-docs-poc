Private Access Connectors connect your internal applications with Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access, which allows you to control access to sensitive corporate resources. To ensure high availability (HA) and facilitate load-balancing on high traffic apps, install and group together at least 2 connectors in each environment. Before attempting to deploy the Private Access Connector, ensure that your environment meets the minimum system requirements. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, go to Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Private Access Configuration. For customers that need to create a new connector group, click Add Private Access Connector Group.",
