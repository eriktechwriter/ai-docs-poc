The etcd pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml controls various parameters that set the behavior of the etcd service in the master node. etcd is a highly- available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Note By default, /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml file has permissions of 640. Audit Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.",
