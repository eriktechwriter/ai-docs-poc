Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides Email Recovery to retain emails that were deleted due to policy rule matches. This allows for restoration of emails that were mistakenly deleted before they are permanently purged and become unrecoverable. With Email Recovery, Cloud Email Gateway Protection helps ensure your business continuity and reduce the risk of data loss. When enabled, Cloud Email Gateway Protection retains deleted emails for 14 days and manages the recovery process. Automatic email recovery may take place in instances where certain conditions, such as system updates, lead to a higher number of false positives. In such cases, Cloud Email Gateway Protection utilizes specialized tools to restore all affected emails.",
