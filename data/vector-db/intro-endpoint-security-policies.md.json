Important Endpoint security policies (unified assignment) only support endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent version 202507 release or later installed. Certain settings require credits to enable. If this is your first time using the new Endpoint Security Policies, please read Before you enroll. This version of Endpoint Security Policies is an updated and improved version which integrates most features from Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection. However, support for some features is still under development. Review Before you enroll to avoid any potential interruption to your security environment.",

Endpoint security policies modularize features and the component pieces of policies, enabling settings and policies to be reused across your security environment. Endpoint Security Policies To create and assign settings across your endpoints, use the following steps: Configure policy resources. Policy resources include rules, lists, and schedules for use with configuring security modules in your policies. You can also use policy resources to generate authorization tokens for terminating the agent program on an endpoint. Configure the policy. Create policies and configure the security modules to protect and monitor your security environment. Create policy assignments.",
