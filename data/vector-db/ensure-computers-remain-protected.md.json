Follow the steps below to allow your protected computers to reconnect to Server & Workload Protection. Important When reconnecting, a removed computer does not have an assigned policy and is added as a new computer. Server & Workload Protection removes any direct links to the computer from event data. You can automatically assign a policy assigned to a computer upon agent-initiated activation with an event-based task. Procedure Go to Endpoint Security → Server & Workload Protection. In Server & Workload Protection, go to Administration → System Settings → Agents.",
