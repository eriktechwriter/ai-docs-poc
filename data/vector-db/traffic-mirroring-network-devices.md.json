You can use a physical network switch and other network devices to set up traffic mirroring between the monitored port and the Virtual Network Sensor data port. Follow the guidance provided by your device manufacturer to configure your network settings. After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command show traffic to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic.
