Credit usage for Attack Surface Risk Management apps is calculated based on the number of assessable desktops, servers, and connected cloud accounts. Each assessed desktop or server requires 20 credits, while each connected cloud account requires 8,000 credits. If you feel the number of assets discovered by Trend Vision One is inaccurate, you can manually override the number of assessed assets and your credit usage will be recalculated. If you previously purchased a Risk Insights license, you will retain your current pricing model until the license expires.",
