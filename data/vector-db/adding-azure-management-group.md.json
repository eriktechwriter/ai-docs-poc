Cloud Accounts supports adding subscriptions in your Azure management groups by deploying features to the tenant root group or a child management group. Adding your Azure management group to Cloud Accounts provides a quick way to allow Trend Vision One access to your managed Azure subscriptions to provide security and visibility into your cloud assets. Some Cloud Account features have limited support for Azure regions. For more information, see Azure supported regions and limitations. The primary subscription is the subscription where the connector resources are created and deployed, and is used by Trend Vision One to connect to all the other subscriptions in the management group.",
