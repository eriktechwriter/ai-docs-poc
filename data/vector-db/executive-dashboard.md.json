Cyber Risk Overview provides information about your company's overall Cyber Risk Index, which is a comprehensive score based on the dynamic assessment of risk factors in your organization. The Cyber Risk Index automatically updates every four hours. Changes to the status of risk events are reflected in the Cyber Risk Index after up to one hour. You may also manually recalculate the Cyber Risk Index by clicking Recalculate. Manual recalculations take up to one hour to display. Note When you allocate credits to Cyber Risk Exposure Management, only assets you have enabled for assessment are used to calculate the Cyber Risk Index.",
