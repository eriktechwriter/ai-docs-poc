Tested Phone Specifications Model RAM OS Kernel Version SDK Version Google Pixel 6 8 GB Android 13 5.10 1.05.6020 CPU Usage The following chart shows the CPU resources used by Mobile Security as a percentage of total CPU usage.Observations: CPU usage increased during scanning and decreased rapidly after scan completion CPU usage increased when detecting a suspicious URL in the browser Conclusion: The Mobile Security app did not exceed 35% of CPU resources on the tested device, and the average value was about 20% when CPU resources were used. The Mobile Security app used almost no CPU resources when idle.",
