Quarantine Renames and then moves the infected file to a temporary quarantine directory on the endpoint. The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent then sends quarantined files to the designated quarantine directory, which is on the managing server by default. The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent encrypts quarantined files sent to this directory. For more information, see Quarantine Directory. Clean Cleans the infected file before allowing full access to the file. If the file is uncleanable, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions: Quarantine, Delete, Rename, and Pass. This action can be performed on all types of security threats except probable virus/malware. Note Some files are uncleanable. For details, see Uncleanable Files.",
