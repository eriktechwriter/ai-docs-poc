Actions fall into these classes: Intercept actions: Actions in this class intercept the message, preventing it from reaching the original recipient. Intercept actions include deleting the entire message and re-addressing the message. Note Intercept actions are terminal actions. For more details about terminal actions, see “Intercept” actions. Modify actions: Actions in this class change the message or its attachments. Modify actions include cleaning cleanable viruses, deleting message attachments, inserting a stamp in the message body, or tagging the subject line. Note Modify actions are non-terminal actions, as the email can continue to be processed by lower-priority policy rules after the triggered rule applies the modify action.",

    "content": "Modify actions can be combined, such as Delete matching attachments and Insert stamp in body. Monitor actions: Actions in this class allow administrators to monitor messaging. Monitor actions include sending a notification message to others or sending a BCC (blind carbon copy) of the message to others. Encrypt Email Message actions: Actions in this class encrypt the message and then queue it for delivery. This is a non-intercept action, but no other actions can be taken on the target message after this policy rule is triggered. This action has the lowest priority of all actions, but when triggered it is always the final policy rule run before the message is queued for delivery. If more than one policy rule in the policy rule set is triggered, the policy rule that uses the encrypt email action will always be triggered last. Note This action only applies to outbound policy rules.",
