When a user or device matches the criteria in a risk control rule, based on the actions configured, Trend Vision One monitors the user or device's subsequent activity and takes action when the monitored activity occurs. For example, when a user with a persistent high risk score attempts to sign in to a new browser session or access an internal app of your organization the action could be blocked. Note Some risk control rules types can be modified in classic view. New risk control rules must be created in playbook view. Procedure On the Secure Access Rules screen, click the Risk Control tab and then click a rule name. If the modify rule screen appears in playbook view, click Switch to Classic View. Note Classic view is not available for all risk control rule types.",
