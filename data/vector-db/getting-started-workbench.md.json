The collected data is then available for analytic or compliance purposes throughout Trend Vision One. You may set specific ingestion and retention policies on a particular log repository to more efficiently organize collected log data and quickly access the data when needed. Ingested data is available for use in XDR Data Explorer, Workbench, Detection Model Management, and Observed Attack Techniques. Enable WebGL in your web browser.
