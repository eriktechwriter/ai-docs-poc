    "content": "Furthermore, the Pre-release features may move from the \"Pre-release\" status to an official general release if certain improvements are made based on customers’ feedback or other internally-generated processes, but keep in mind that SOME or ALL Pre-release features may never be made available for general release by Trend Micro at its sole discretion.\n\nThere is no additional charge for pre-release features before official release, but features will not necessarily remain free after official release. If Trend Micro determines that such feature will be officially released, you may be required to pay to continue using the Trend Vision One feature. We will notify you at least 30 days before official release or any upcoming charge. If you do not want to be charged, please discontinue use by opting out of the feature from Platform Directory before official release.",
