You can define allow criteria to ensure that Application Control never blocks a certain application, or you can create a complete list of applications allowed to execute on endpoints and then deploy a Lockdown policy to the endpoints. While in Lockdown mode, users cannot execute, access, or install any application that you did not include in the allow criteria. For more information about Lockdown policies, see Application Control Policy Settings. Procedure Go to Policies → Policy Resources → Application Control Criteria. The Application Control Criteria screen appears. Click Add Criteria and select Allow. The Allow Criteria Settings screen appears. Type a unique Name for the criteria. Select the level of Trust permission for the applications.",
