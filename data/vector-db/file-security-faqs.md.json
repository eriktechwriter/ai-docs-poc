Trend Vision One™ – File Security is an innovative solution engineered to bolster the security posture of files and cloud storage against the relentless tide of malware threats. Based on different needs, there are two features in File Security: File Security SDK is an scanner app that can assess files for malware and display real-time results so you can immediately identify and address likely security issues in your files. File Security SDK can leverage the power of predictive machine learning (PML) to match novel variants against known hazards.",

It leverages the account scanner stack features in Trend Cloud One – File Storage Security, but is much easier to deploy using cloud account management (CAM). File Security Storage provides complete visibility of your cloud storage inventory within the Trend Vision One console so you can protect multiple buckets at once. For more information, see What is File Security. How does Trend Vision One – File Security differ from Trend Micro Cloud One – File Storage Security? Aside from being part of Trend Vision One, the biggest difference is that we have expanded functionality. In Trend Cloud One, File Storage Security can only scan files in cloud storage.
