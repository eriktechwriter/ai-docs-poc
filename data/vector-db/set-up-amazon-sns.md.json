Next steps See the sections below for details on how to perform these tasks. Related information SNS configuration in JSON format Create an AWS user In order to use Amazon SNS with Server & Workload Protection, you need to create an AWS user with the appropriate permissions for SNS. Note the access key and secret key for the user, because you will need that information for step 3, below. The AWS user will need the \"sns:Publish\" permission on all SNS topics that Server & Workload Protection will publish to.",
