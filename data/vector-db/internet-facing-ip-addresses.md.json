Attack Surface Discovery discovers your internet-facing IP addresses by checking A records for your domains, the pointer (PTR) records for the related IPs, and information from your domains' SSL certificates. You may also add IP addresses manually. Manually added IP addresses undergo a secondary verification process before appearing in Internet-Facing Assets. Data for internet-facing IP addresses is updated daily. IP-related risks are identified based on the following factors: Factor Example of risk Service Unexpected service observed on the public network Port Unexpected port observed CVE Application vulnerability identified on internet-facing assets The following table outlines the actions you can perform on the Public IPs tab: Action Description",
