This can cause problems when common objects have their child objects split across different groups and users, but their access is shared. For example, this can be a malware scan configuration that uses the child object's directory, file extension, or file lists, or can be a policy that uses malware scan configs. This shared access can create issues if users modify objects that they can access but technically belong to a different group. Role-based access control (RBAC) for common objects allows your administrator to control the access scope of each role for the following common objects: Malware scan configurations Directory lists File extension lists File lists You can set up user roles and asset visibility scope by accessing the User Roles",

This allows roles without view-only permissions to have full or custom access to specific objects, but retain view-only access for the rest. It also ensures that edit access to a specific object belongs only to the role that requires it.
