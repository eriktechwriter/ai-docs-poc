If your security environment uses a hybrid deployment, or you do not have VMware or Microsoft Hyper-V in your environment, you can leverage your Azure subscriptions to deploy a Virtual Network Sensor instance. Note The steps contained in these instructions are valid as of January 2024. Before you begin, make sure you have completed the following tasks: Choose or create a virtual network for the Virtual Network Sensor instance. Choose or create the network security group and subnets for the Virtual Network Sensor data port and management port. Trend Micro recommends using different subnets for the data and management ports. Procedure Sign in to the Azure console.",
