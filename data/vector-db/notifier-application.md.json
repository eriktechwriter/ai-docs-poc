The notifier displays pop-up user notifications when the agent begins a scan, or blocks malware or access to malicious web pages. The notifier does consume resources (or \"has a footprint\") on the client machine, requiring on Windows less than 1MB of disk space and 1MB of memory, and on macOS less than 10MB of disk space and 50MB of memory. When the notifier is running, the notifier icon appears in the taskbar in the lower right of a Windows screen or in the menu bar at the top of a macOS screen. The notifier is automatically installed by default with the agent for Windows and macOS computers.",
