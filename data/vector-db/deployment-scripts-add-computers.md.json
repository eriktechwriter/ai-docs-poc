For more information, see Run the deployment script. The following steps are no longer considered valid and are included for reference use only. Adding a computer to your list of protected resources in Server & Workload Protection and implementing protection is a multi-step process. Almost all of these steps can be performed from the command line on the computer and can therefore be scripted. The Server & Workload Protection console contains a deployment script writing assistant which can be accessed from the Support menu.",

Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again. The PowerShell script expects the environment variable for ProgramFiles to be set to \"Program Files\", not \"Program Files (x86)\". To resolve the issue, close PowerShell (x86) and run the script in PowerShell as an administrator. The deployment script can be modified to perform agent updates instead of new installs by changing the rpm -ihv to rpm -U. If there is a need to control the specific agent version used by the deployment scripts there are 2 options to meet this goal: Use agent version control.
