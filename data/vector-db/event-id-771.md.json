Common causes include: Cloned VMs or cloud instances if you haven't enabled Reactivate cloned Agents. Computers deleted from Computers before deactivating the agent, if you haven't enabled Reactivate unknown Agents. The agent software continues to try to periodically connect to Server & Workload Protection, causing the event each time until either it is uninstalled, or you reactivate the computer. Interrupted sync of a connector such as AWS or Azure. Solutions vary by the cause.",

See Uninstall Server & Workload Protection from endpoints. Reactivate the computer or clone If you want to protect the computer, activate it with Server & Workload Protection. Re-activation re-establishes the agent's certificate so that Server & Workload Protection can authenticate it with the list on Computers, and recognize the computer. See Agent-Initiated Activation.
