For example, a heartbeat includes 3 instances of the \"Execution of Unrecognized Software Allowed\" event for the Test_6_file.sh file, and no other instances of that event. Server & Workload Protection aggregates these 3 events for the file Test_6_file.sh. When the event occurs for many files, the log omits the rules link, path, file name, and user name. For example, a heartbeat includes 21 instances of the \"Execution of Unrecognized Software Allowed\" event that occurred for several different files. Server & Workload Protection aggregates the 21 events in a single event, but does not include a rules link, path, file name, or user name. When aggregated events apply to multiple files, other occurrences of these events have likely been reported in other heartbeats.",
