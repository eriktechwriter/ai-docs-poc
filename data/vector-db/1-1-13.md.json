As part of initial cluster setup, default kubeconfig files are created to be used by the administrator of the cluster. These files contain private keys and certificates which allow for privileged access to the cluster. You should restrict their file permissions to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the file(s). The file(s) should be readable and writable by only the administrators on the system. Note By default, admin.conf and super-admin.conf have permissions of 600. Audit Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.",
