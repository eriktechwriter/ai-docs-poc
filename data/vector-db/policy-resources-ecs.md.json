The first available feature is the approved and blocked lists, enabling administrators to define trusted or suspicious senders and content once and apply them consistently across supported solutions, including Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection and Cloud Email Gateway Protection. This reduces duplicated setup effort and ensures uniform enforcement. For solution-specific control, configurations can still be made individually. In this release, only sender addresses are supported for the approved list, with more object types and common lists coming soon under Policy Resources.",
