Starting with version 3.0.0, Helm chart is also in a new location in GitHub: https://github.com/trendmicro/visionone-container-security-helm. Important This Helm chart upgrade does not work if any of your Container Protection policies include Block actions. Change your policies to Log actions before you upgrade Helm. Update firewall exceptions Before you upgrade your clusters, you must add and remove the following firewall exceptions. These updated exceptions can also be seen in Firewall exception requirements for Trend Vision One.",
