Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection provides anti-malware scanning for potential threats, such as viruses, Trojans, and spyware, in your AWS EBS, ECR, and Lambda resources. Anti-malware scanning is not enabled for AWS by default. You may enable the feature at any time in Cloud Accounts for existing AWS accounts or when deploying a new CloudFormation template. If you enable anti-malware scanning on an existing AWS account, scanning begins during the next daily scan. Scan times are not configurable. Procedure Go to Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → AWS and click Add Account. Choose CloudFormation as the deployment method, select Single AWS Account, and click Next.",
