Virtual Network Sensor is a lightweight network sensor that scans your network activity and feeds network activity data to Trend Vision One and allows you to discover unmanaged assets and gain a holistic view of your attack surface. Before using the features of Network Security, you need to set up your Virtual Network Sensor and connect your sensor to Trend Vision One. Important If the throughput exceeds 2000 Mbps, Trend Micro recommends configuring your Virtual Network Sensor using a PCI passthrough that is compliant with the following drivers: Broadcom tg3 and bnxt_en, and Intel i40e, igb, ixgbe, and e1000. Note Review the Virtual Network Sensor system requirements before starting and ensure you have adequate resources for Virtual Network Sensor.",
