(dot) Any character (byte) except newline x The character 'x' \\\\ The character '\\' \\a The alert (bell) character (ASCII 0x07) \\b If this meta-symbol is within square brackets [] or by itself, it will be treated as the backspace character (ASCII 0x08). For example, [\\b] or \\b If this meta-symbol is at the beginning (or end) of a regular expression, it means any matched string of the regular expression must check whether the left (or right) side of the matched string is a boundary. For example: \\bluck > left side must be the boundary luck\\b > right side must be the boundary \\bluck\\b > both sides must be the boundary If this meta-symbol appears in the middle of a regular expression, it will cause a syntax error.",
