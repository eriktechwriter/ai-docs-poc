However, visibility into low-impact CVEs (CVEs with an impact score range of 0-30) may also be necessary for your organization to meet compliance requirements or follow internal policies. You can now configure your level of CVE coverage in Threat and Exposure Management. To learn more, see CVE assessment visibility and configuration.
