The root account owner can modify every policy in the list, while other account owners can only modify the policies they created. After a policy is modified, Trend Micro Apex Central deploys the policy to the targets. Important Each managed product provides different policy settings that you can configure and deploy to policy targets. You can find a complete list of supported managed products and the policy settings for each in the Apex Central as a Service Widget and Policy Management Guide. You can download a PDF version of the guide, or view the guide online, using the following link: https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/apex-one-as-a-service.aspx For a parent policy for the Apex One agent, if you modified the targets and settings for specific features, the modifications will apply to all child policie",

Modifications to these parent policy permissions are also applied to child policies and deployed to targets. For a list of settings that support permissions, see Working with Parent Policy Settings. For example: If you changed the scan schedule permission from \"Inherit from parent\" to \"Are customizable\", administrators can start to customize the existing schedule on their child policies. If you changed the Manual Scan file extensions permission from \"Extend from parent\" to \"Inherit from parent\", any file extensions that administrators added to child policies will be removed. In addition, administrators will no longer be able to add file extensions. Procedure Navigate to Policies → Policy Management. The Policy Management screen appears.
