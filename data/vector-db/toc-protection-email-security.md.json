Trend Micro analyzes those URLs at the time of click, and will block access to them or show a warning page (depending on your settings) if they are malicious. You can choose to use the default blocking and warning pages or customize the blocking and warning pages according to your preference. Procedure Go to Inbound Protection → Spam Filtering → Time-of-Click Protection. In the Actions section, do the following: Dangerous: Select an action (Allow, Warn or Block) to take on dangerous URLs. The default value is Block. Dangerous URLs are verified to be fraudulent or known sources of threats. Highly Suspicious: Select an action (Allow, Warn or Block) to take on highly suspicious URLs.",
