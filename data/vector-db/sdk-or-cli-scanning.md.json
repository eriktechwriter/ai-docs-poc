The SDK and CLI scanner stack scans all incoming files for known malware and active content. File Security SDK can send notifications and quarantine malware. The following architecture diagram illustrates the main File Security SDK information flow. The following SDKs are available in GitHub: SDK for Go SDK for Java SDK for Node SDK for Python The command-line interface (CLI) is also available in GitHub. When deciding which method is best for your organization, consider the following table.",

This ensures that all data transmitted between the client and the Trend service remains thoroughly encrypted and safeguarded. The certificate employed by server-side TLS is a publicly-signed certificate from Trend Micro Inc, issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), further bolstering security measures. The File Security SDK consistently adopts TLS as the default communication channel, prioritizing security at all times.",
