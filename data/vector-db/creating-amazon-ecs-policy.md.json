Important Policy configuration for Kubernetes clusters differs greatly from a Amazon ECS environment. To properly configure Kubernetes protection policies, see Creating a Kubernetes protection policy. Procedure Go to Cloud Security → Container Security → Configuration. Click the Policy tab. Create a policy by clicking New. Specify a unique policy name. Note Policy names must not contain spaces and only support alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), and periods (.). You cannot modify the policy name after creating the policy. To provide more detail about the purpose for the policy, use the Description field. The description appears under the policy name in the policy list.",
