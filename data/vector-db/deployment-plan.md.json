After the Trend Micro Apex Central server downloads a new component version from an update source, you can configure Trend Micro Apex Central to deploy updated components to managed products immediately, at a specified time, or after a delay period. You can configure Trend Micro Apex Central to deploy updated components to selected managed products based on different deployment schedules. When creating a deployment schedule, consider the following: You can only select one folder or managed product for each deployment schedule. However, you can specify more than one schedule for the deployment plan.",

    "content": "Trend Micro Apex Central bases the deployment plan delays on the completion time of the download, and these delays are independent of each other. For example, if you have three folders to update at 5-minute intervals, you can assign the first folder a delay of 5 minutes, and then set delays of 10 and 15 minutes for the two remaining folders, respectively. Note If you do not specify a deployment schedule in the deployment plan, Trend Micro Apex Central downloads the updates but does not deploy updated components to managed products.
