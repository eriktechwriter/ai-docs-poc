Each Check has the following information associated with it: Procedure Status Failure - rule has failed for a specific resource Success - rule has passed for a specific resource Suppressed - rule has been suppressed and its status will not be included in your compliance score Failure introduced date A message describing the issue Account Region A link to the resource Check Actions You can take the following actions on a Check: Procedure Resolv",

For example, if you have an S3 bucket with public read permissions enabled, the “S3 Bucket Public 'READ' Access”’ Rule will be applied towards all S3 buckets in your AWS account. If any S3 bucket has Public Read enabled, then the Check for that S3 bucket is a failure. Not Scored Checks Some rules are documented by Cloud Risk Management but cannot be tested against your cloud infrastructure due to not being applicable to cloud infrastructure or limitations of the data provided by the cloud provider. Rules that are only informational are identified as Not Scored.",
