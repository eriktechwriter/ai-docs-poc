    "content": "By assigning \"asset values\" to computers, and assigning \"severity values\" to log inspection rules, the importance (\"rank\") of an event is calculated by multiplying the two values together. This allows you to sort events by rank. Severity: The log inspection rule's severity value. Groups: Group that the rule belongs to. Program Name: Program name. This is obtained from the syslog header of the event. Event: The name of the event. Location: Where the log came from. Source IP: The packet's source IP. Source Port: The packet's source port. Destination IP: The packet's destination IP address. Destination Port: The packet's destination port. Protocol: Possible values are \"ICMP\", \"ICMPV6\", \"IGMP\", \"GGP\", \"TCP\", \"PUP\", \"UDP\", \"IDP\", \"ND\", \"RAW\", \"TCP+UDP\", AND \"Other: nnn\" where nnn represents a three digit decimal value. Action: The action taken within the event Source User: Originating user within the event. Destination User: Destination user within the event.",
