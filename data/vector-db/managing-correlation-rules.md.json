Trend Micro defines a set of correlation rules and detection signals, and continually introduces new rules and signals. Each predefined correlation rule consists of one or multiple predefined detection signals. You can also add custom correlation rules to accommodate detection requirements in your environment. The following table outlines the available actions on the Correlation Rules tab of the Correlation Rules and Detection Signals screen. The Correlation Rules Tab Action Description Enable or disable a correlation rule On the Correlation Rules tab, click the Enable or Disable icon in the Status column of a correlation rule. The configurations apply to anomaly detection in all Correlated Intelligence policy rules.",

Targeted threat type: The currently supported threat types of Trend Micro specified anomalies include Suspicious Email and Possibly Unwanted Email. Aggressive level: Trend Micro classifies its predefined correlation rules for anomaly detection into three aggressive levels. Moderate: This level is designed to seek a balance between effective anomaly detection and maintaining a relatively low rate of false positives. It is suitable for everyday monitoring and for customers who prefer a safer approach without significant disruptions to their regular email flow. Aggressive: This level increases the sensitivity of anomaly detection and offers a more robust detection capability, which may result in a higher number of false positives.",
