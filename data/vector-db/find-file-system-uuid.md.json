Universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) are 128-bit-long numbers represented by 32 hexadecimal digits. UUIDs are used to uniquely identify partitions in a computer system. When malware is detected by Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection, you may use the UUID in the risk event metadata to search for more information, such as the location of the malware, in XDR Data Explorer. If no UUID is provided, you may still find the UUID using CLI commands. Related information Find the UUID in Windows Find the UUID in Linux Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
