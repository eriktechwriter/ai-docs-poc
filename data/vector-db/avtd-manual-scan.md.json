Scan types and resources available for scanning depend on the configuration you applied when you connected your cloud account in Cloud Accounts. Important You must have sufficient asset visibility scope to scan cloud assets. The manual scanning feature requires the latest stack versions. If the Scan action is disabled, update your stacks in Cloud Accounts. The following scan types and resources are available for each supported cloud provider.",
