There are two pricing models for Trend Vision One Cyber Risk Exposure Management. The old pricing model is available to customers who previously purchased the Attack Surface Risk Management (add-on to XDR) license entitlement, formerly called Risk Insights Capabilities. Although the old pricing model is not available to new customers, customers who purchased the Attack Surface Risk Management (add-on to XDR) license retain the original pricing model until the license expires, or until you disable and re-enable Cyber Risk Exposure Management in Trend Vision One.",

In other words, enabling Cyber Risk Exposure Management on the old pricing model doubles your credit allocation to XDR sensors. The old pricing model does not charge for cloud accounts. The new pricing model is the only model available to new customers, as well as to customers whose Attack Surface Risk Management (add-on to XDR) license entitlement has expired. The new Cyber Risk Exposure Management offering comprises two features, Cyber Risk Exposure Management and Cloud Risk Management. The credit requirement of the new pricing model is based on your number of assessed desktops or servers and cloud accounts. The new pricing model does not charge for network or email.",
