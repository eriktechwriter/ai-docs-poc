When a new endpoint registers to Trend Micro Apex Central, it goes through the filtered policies in the list in descending order. Trend Micro Apex Central assigns the new endpoint to a filtered policy when the following conditions are both satisfied: The new endpoint matches the target criteria of the policy The policy creator has the permission to manage the new endpoint The following table describes the policy list columns that display on the Policy Management screen. Click a column to sort the data. Policy List Column Description Priority Displays the priority of the policies Trend Micro Apex Central lists policies from the highest to the lowest priority. When administrators create a filtered policy, Trend Micro Apex Central saves the new policy as the lowest priority policy.",
