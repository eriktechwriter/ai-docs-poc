Severity breakdown An overview of the severity levels of successful attacks on your AI model, organized into Critical, High, Medium, and Low severity levels. Top attack objectives A chart displaying the most commonly used attack objectives targeting your AI model. An attack objective is the outcome that an attack on an AI model attempts to produce, such as the disclosure of sensitive data. Top attack techniques A chart displaying the most common techniques used to attack your AI model, such as DAN (Do Anything Now) prompts.",
