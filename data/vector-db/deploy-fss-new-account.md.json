You can apply them to either a single or an organization account. The first time you time deploy a File Security Storage stack, it, by default, monitors all the S3 buckets in which EventBridge is on. When you add or remove the monitoring buckets, File Security Storage stores the list of monitoring buckets in the config. File Security Storage scans buckets based on the config. (This behavior is for backward compatibility.",

Before stack version 1.2.0, you need to turn on or turn off EventBridge to control whether the scanning is enable or not. In stack versions 1.2.0 or greater, File Security Storage creates an S3 configuration bucket in your environment. it uses the information in this configuration bucket to determine whether to scan a specific bucket. Every time you turn on scanning, File Security Storage enables EventBridge. However, if you turn off scanning, File Security Storage does not disable EventBridge, but rather saves the current scanning status in the configuration bucket.",

The Inventory is updated when Trend Vision One carries out its scheduled asset sync. This occurs every hour for licensed Trend Vision One users and once per day for non-licensed users.
