You can still use APIs to add new accounts to Server & Workload Protection. However, Trend Micro recommends using the Cloud Accounts app, which provides access to more advanced cloud security and XDR capabilities. This topic is for reference only. AWS Systems Manager Distributor is a feature integrated with AWS Systems Manager that you can use to securely store and distribute software packages in your accounts. By integrating Server & Workload Protection with AWS Systems Manager Distributor, you can distribute agents across multiple platforms, control access to managed instances, and automate your deployments.
