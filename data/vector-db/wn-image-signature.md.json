This rule, available in Kubernetes protection policies, validates that container images are signed by a trusted source using the Cosign tool before they are deployed to your cluster. You can create rules that automatically block or log any image that is not signed with one of your approved public keys, ensuring that only authentic and untampered images can run in your environment. Use conditions to apply this verification to specific image registries or repositories for granular control. Important To verify signatures for images stored in private registries, you must configure your Helm override file to allow the admission controller to access your registry.",
