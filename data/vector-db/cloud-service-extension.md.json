The Service Gateway appliance helps facilitate traffic from Trend Micro products and managed endpoint agents to Trend Vision One hosted services. To help reduce setup requirements, the cloud service extension acts as an HTTPS proxy to direct certain traffic from your on-premises products to Trend Vision One hosted services. The cloud service extension requires no additional credit allocation to use. Together with the Smart Protection Network Proxy, the cloud service extension can greatly reduce the number of exceptions and FQDNs necessary to configure your firewall. You can easily turn on the cloud service extension in the Service Gateway settings menu.For more information about firewall settings, see Firewall exception requirements for Trend Vision One.",
