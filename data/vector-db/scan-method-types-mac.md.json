Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents can use one of two scan methods when scanning for security risks. The scan methods are smart scan and conventional scan. Smart Scan Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents that use smart scan are referred to as smart scan agents in this document. Smart scan agents benefit from local scans and in-the-cloud queries provided by File Reputation Services. This is the default scan method type. Conventional Scan Agents that do not use smart scan are called conventional scan agents. A conventional scan agent stores all Apex One (Mac) components on the agent endpoint and scans all files locally. Monitoring level is the degree of vigilance and strictness applied when detecting and responding to potential threats.",

    "content": "Raising the level increases the sensitivity of the sensor, which increases the number of detections and alerts. Higher levels allow for more strict monitoring to help with situations like on-going threat investigations, but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends setting your monitoring level to 2 - Moderate to balance more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints. Some components used by higher monitoring levels are not available on all platforms.
