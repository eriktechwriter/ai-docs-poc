The network engine can operate inline or in tap mode. When operating inline, the packet stream passes through the network engine and is either dropped or passed based on the rules you've set. Stateful tables are maintained, Firewall rules are applied and traffic normalization is carried out so that Intrusion Prevention and Firewall rules can be applied. When operating in tap mode, the packet is always passed, with the exception of driver hooking issue or interface isolation. In tap mode, packet delay is also introduced, which can create a drop in throughput. Network Engine Status Check: This setting determines if the agent will monitor the status of the Network Engine. This is enabled by default, but can be disabled. For related events, see Network Engine Status (Windows).",

When a rule is triggered and debug mode is on, the agent will keep a record of the last X packets that passed before the rule was triggered. It will return those packets to Server & Workload Protection as debug events. Note Debug mode can very easily cause excessive log generation and should only be used under Client Services supervision. Number of Packets to retain in Debug Mode: The number of packets to retain and log when debug mode is on. Log All Packet Data: Record the packet data for events that are not associated with specific Firewall or Intrusion Prevention rules. That is, log packet data for events such as \"Dropped Retransmit\" or \"Invalid ACK\". Note Events that have been aggregated because of event folding cannot have their packet data saved.",
