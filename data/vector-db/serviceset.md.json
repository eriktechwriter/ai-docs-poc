To enable and configure Integrity Monitoring, see Set up integrity monitoring. The ServiceSet element represents a set of services (Windows only). Services are identified by the \"service name\", which is not the same as the \"name\" column shown in the Services administrative tool. The service name can be seen in the service properties and is often shorter than the value shown in the \"name\" column, which is actually the \"Display Name\" of the service. For example, the agent has a service name of \"ds_agent\" and a display name of \"Trend Micro Deep Security Agent\".",
