Partial matching is supported except for the Organization field and time related fields. You can select a field and type the first few letters of a keyword to query. Only exact matching is supported for the Organization field and time-related fields. You need to type the time exactly in the MM DD, YYYY HH:MM format you see in the corresponding column. This includes Timestamp. The All Fields fields supports querying Timestamp and all the other fields. Specify a time range to search.",
