The x-axis indicates the ratio of critical threats to total endpoints within a site or reporting line. The y-axis indicates the compliance levels of the sites or reporting lines for the selected compliance indicator. You can use this data to quickly identify high risk users and groups from an integrated Active Directory structure. Note To change the sample chart data and display sites or reporting lines based on your company network, enable Active Directory integration or create custom sites based on IP addresses. Hover over a node to view compliance and critical threat information for particular sites or reporting lines. The tail on a node indicates the direction from which the security status has changed over the specified time period.",
