Note You can use PAC files and proxy chaining concurrently. Option When to Use Pros Cons Proxy auto-configuration (PAC) files When your organization already has a proxy configured and you support users that often work outside the network You can configure and deploy PAC files to the Secure Access Module or the system proxy settings for traffic forwarding.
