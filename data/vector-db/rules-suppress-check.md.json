Suppressed Checks will appear greyed out on the dashboard, and will display 'suppressed' counts on the All Checks report. Currently, we do not support batch suppression. If a Check is suppressed, does it reduce the number of API calls that are made? Suppressing a Check does not reduce the number of API calls made because API calls are made to resources that may be checked by more rules than just the one where the Check has been suppressed. Is there a way to suppress certain rules? No, Suppress is at the Check level. You have the option to disable rules.",
