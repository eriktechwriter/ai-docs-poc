Note Compliance Management identifies gaps and measures progress towards compliance with a framework or standard, but does not provide certification or guarantee compliance. The security layers and remediation actions mapped to each control do not necessarily represent that of the standard or framework authority, and are not equivalent to the related security controls. Use Compliance Management (Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Compliance Management) to identify configuration gaps in your organization and measure progress towards compliance with a specific framework or standard.",
