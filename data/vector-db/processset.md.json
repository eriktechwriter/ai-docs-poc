Group ID can change if the process drops privileges or otherwise switches its effective group credentials. For example, a program could change group IDs temporarily and obtain write privileges to copy installation files into a directory where the user has read-only privileges. On Windows this is the “current\" Primary Group of the process as established by a user-specific access token created at login, which sets access and resource privileges for the user and any processes they execute. Note In addition to a Primary Group, Windows processes typically have one or more additional group credentials associated with them. These additional group credentials are not monitored by the Agent – they can be viewed in the Security tab of the process properties in Process Explorer. Parent: The PID of the process that created this process.",
