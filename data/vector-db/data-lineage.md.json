You can investigate a Data Lineage graph to: determine the origin point of sensitive data view how sensitive data has been transmitted from one endpoint to another view detailed information about a specific file, including file type, file size, and the file's URI. If the file is a zip file, you can expand to see the compressed files. Note To access Data Lineage, you must enable Data Security and then do the following: Create a data policy to specify the network locations you want to monitor for sensitive data. For more information, see Data Policy Configure an endpoint security policy with the Endpoint sensor detection and response and Data Detection Response settings enabled.",
