Important The following instructions only apply to customers with an active license for Trend Micro Web Security. For the regular Internet Access setup process, see Setting up Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access and AI Service Access. Procedure Integrate your IAM (Identity and Access Management) system with Zero Trust Secure Access. Configure a secure internet gateway. If Trend Micro Web Security currently uses a cloud gateway, the settings are migrated to an Internet Access Cloud Gateway when you upgrade. If Trend Micro Web Security currently uses an on-premises gateway but you want to use a cloud gateway with Internet Access, add your corporate locations to the Internet Access Cloud Gateway. If Trend Micro Web Security currently uses an on-premises gateway and you want to continue using an on-premises gateway with Internet Access, deploy an Internet Access On-Premises Gateway.",
