This option is available only for real-time scans. Note Resources accessed in \"~/.gvfs\" via GVFS, a virtual file system available for the GNOME desktop, will be treated as local resources, not network drives. If a virus is detected when scanning a network folder on Windows, the agent may display some \"clean failed\" (delete failed) events. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
