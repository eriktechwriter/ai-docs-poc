Created: Timestamp when the file was created LastModified: Timestamp when the file was last modified LastAccessed: Timestamp when the file was last accessed. On Windows this value does not get updated immediately, and recording of the last accessed timestamp can be disabled as a performance enhancement. See File Times for details. The other problem with this attribute is that the act of scanning a file requires that the Agent open the file, which will change its last accessed timestamp. On Unix, the Agent will use the O_NOATIME flag if it is available when opening the file, which prevents the OS from updating the last accessed timestamp and speeds up scanning.",
