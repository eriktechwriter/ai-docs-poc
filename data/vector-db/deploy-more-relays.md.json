Long distance and network latency can slow down update redistribution. Downloading from other geographic regions can also increase network bandwidth and/or cloud costs. Network architecture and bandwidth limits: If you have network segments with limited bandwidth, those segments should each have their own relay group with at least 2 relays.",

    "content": "Low bandwidth Internet/WAN connections, routers, firewalls, VPNs, VPCs, or proxy devices (which can all define a network segment) can be bottlenecks when large traffic volumes travel between the networks. Bottlenecks slow down update redistribution. Agents therefore usually should use local relays inside the same network segment — not relays outside on bottlenecked external networks. Use of Application Control shared rulesets through a proxy connection: If you will use shared Application Control rulesets and agents connect through a proxy, you might want to add more relays to handle large rulesets and improve performance. See Deploy Application Control rulesets via relays and Server & Workload Protection Sizing. Create relay groups Relays must be organized into relay groups. The default relays provided by the Server & Workload Protection service are in a relay group named \"Primary Tenant Relay Group\". If you want to add your own relays, add a new relay group.",
