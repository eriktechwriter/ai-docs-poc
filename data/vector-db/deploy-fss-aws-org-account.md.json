T=You can apply them to either a single or an organization account. The first time you time deploy a File Security Storage stack, it, by default, monitors all the S3 buckets in which EventBridge is on. When you add or remove the monitoring buckets, File Security Storage stores the list of monitoring buckets in the config. File Security Storage scans buckets based on the config. (This behavior is for backward compatibility.",

Before stack version 1.2.0, you need to turn on or turn off EventBridge to control whether the scanning is enable or not. In stack versions 1.2.0 or greater, File Security Storage creates an S3 configuration bucket in your environment. it uses the information in this configuration bucket to determine whether to scan a specific bucket. Every time you turn on scanning, File Security Storage enables EventBridge. However, if you turn off scanning, File Security Storage does not disable EventBridge, but rather saves the current scanning status in the configuration bucket.",

If, however, you remove the existing stack and then re-install a new stack instead of updating the stack, File Security Storage considers this a new installation, and you lose the previous settings. Note When you add a bucket to your CloudFormation template, it does not immediately appear in the File Security Inventory. The Inventory is updated when Trend Vision One carries out its scheduled asset sync. This occurs every hour for licensed Trend Vision One users and once per day for non-licensed users. To have the bucket added in real-time, you can enable Real-Time Posture Monitoring. You can deploy File Security Storage when adding an AWS account to Trend Vision One.
