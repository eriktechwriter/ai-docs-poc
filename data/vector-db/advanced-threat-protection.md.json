Where once attackers were content to simply deface a website or gain notoriety through mass system disruption, they now realize that they can make significant money, steal important data, or interfere with major infrastructure systems via cyber warfare instead. A targeted attack is a long-term cyber-espionage campaign against a person or organization to gain persistent access to the target network. Persistent access can allow attackers to extract confidential company data or damage the target network over a period of time. Compromised networks can be used for attacks against other organizations, making it harder to trace the attack back to its originator.",
