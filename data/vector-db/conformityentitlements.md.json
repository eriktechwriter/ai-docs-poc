Important This is a \"Pre-release\" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-release disclaimer before using the feature. Entitlements currently only supports AWS accounts. Cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) is a complex task that involves managing user and machine identities and privileges across a great volume of cloud resources. Without proper visibility and management, privileged user or machine identities with excessive permissions can lead to data breaches and other security risks. CIEM identifies risky cloud identities to help users enforce the principle of least privilege throughout the corporate cloud infrastructure.",
