Internet Access allows you to restrict access to cloud apps that support tenancy restrictions by creating tenancy restriction rules and applying them to secure access rules. For example, you might want the employees in your organization to sign in to a cloud app such as Google Workspace using corporate accounts rather than personal accounts. When a user makes an HTTP or HTTPS request to a supported cloud app, the request is forwarded to the Internet Access Gateway. The gateway then inserts required HTTP/HTTPS header fields for the cloud app along with the specified values, allowing the app to identify what content the user may access.",
