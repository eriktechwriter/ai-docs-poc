The Security Features and XDR Sensors sections provide an overview of feature coverage within your environment. Important Targeted Attack Detection requires enabling Smart Feedback on management servers to begin analyzing your Smart Protection Network data. Enabling Smart Feedback and XDR sensors improves attack visibility. Enabling Predictive Machine Learning and Behavior Monitoring enhance security capability. Targeted Attack Detection displays coverage as a percentage. For security features, this is the percentage of management servers in your environment with the feature enabled.",
