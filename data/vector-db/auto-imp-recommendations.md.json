Rules that are excluded from recommendation scans. Rules that have been automatically assigned or unassigned, but that a user has overridden. For example, if Server & Workload Protection automatically assigns a rule and then you unassign it, the next recommendation scan does not reassign that rule. Rules that have been assigned at a higher level in the policy hierarchy cannot be unassigned at a lower level. A rule assigned to a computer at the policy level must be unassigned at the policy level. Rules that Trend Micro has issued, but which may pose a risk of producing false positives. This is addressed in the rule description.",
