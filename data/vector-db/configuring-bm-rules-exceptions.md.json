Use the Event Monitoring feature to assess or block behaviors commonly associated with malware threats. Note By default, Behavior Monitoring is disabled on all versions of Windows Server platforms. Procedure Click the Rules tab. Select Enable Behavior Monitoring. Configure the Monitoring Level settings for Detection and Prevention. Important Higher monitoring levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends selecting 2 - Moderate for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints. The Prevention level must be the same or lower than Detection.",
