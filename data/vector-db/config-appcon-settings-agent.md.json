Application Control policies require the use of preconfigured criteria that define which applications you want to Allow or Block on an endpoint or for a particular user. For more information, see Application Control Criteria. Procedure Select Enable Application Control. In the User-defined Rules section, assign rules to the endpoint based on the logged on user account. Important User-based Application Control is only available if you have integrated Active Directory. If you do not have Active Directory integration, you can only assign criteria to the default All user accounts rule. You cannot delete the default All user accounts rule. Add a new rule or modify an existing rule. To add a new rule, click Assign Rule.",
