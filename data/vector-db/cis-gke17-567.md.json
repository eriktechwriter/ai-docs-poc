Encrypting traffic between users and the Kubernetes workload is fundamental to protecting data sent over the web. Google-managed SSL Certificates are provisioned, renewed, and managed for domain names. This is only available for HTTPS load balancers created using Ingress Resources, and not TCP/UDP load balancers created using service of type:LoadBalancer. Note By default, Google-managed SSL Certificates are not created when an Ingress resource is defined. Impact Google-managed SSL Certificates are less flexible than certificates that are self obtained and managed. Managed certificates support a single, non-wildcard domain. Self-managed certificates can support wildcards and multiple subject alternative names (SANs).",
