Trend Micro provides phishing simulations to enhance information security awareness of your employees against the latest threats and educate them to quickly and efficiently spot attacks. Trend Micro phishing simulations enable you to test what could happen to your organization before the hackers try. You can also let Cloud Email Gateway Protection skip scans for incoming emails sent from third-party phishing simulation services by adding their IP addresses to the list. Note A maximum of 10 third-party phishing simulation services is supported. Procedure Go to Administration → Other Settings → Service Integration and click Phishing Simulation.",
