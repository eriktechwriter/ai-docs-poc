For example, Jenkins projects can automatically build, test, and push Docker images to a Docker registry. Once pushed, the image may be instantly available to run in an orchestration environment. If open source vulnerabilities exist in the image, then they are a risk when the image is run. Since images are intended to be immutable, images should be scanned before they're deployed to a cluster. TMAS scans artifacts inside your CI/CD pipelines. You can install the Trend Micro Artifact Scanner CLI into your CI/CD pipeline to perform scans before artifacts are deployed to production. For vulnerability scans, TMAS takes the artifact that you want to scan and generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).",
