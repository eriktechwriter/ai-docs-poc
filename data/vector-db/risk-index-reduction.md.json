The following table outlines the actions that directly impact the Cyber Risk Index. Note The Cyber Risk Index automatically updates every four hours. Changes to the status of risk events are reflected in the Cyber Risk Index after up to one hour. You may also manually recalculate the Cyber Risk Index by clicking the Recalculate button. Manual recalculations take up to one hour to display. Action Description Remediate risk events Taking the recommended remediation steps might automatically adjust the Cyber Risk Index, depending on the risk event. For example, Cyber Risk Exposure Management recommends applying the latest patches or upgrading the operating system whenever vulnerability-related risk events are detected.",

Remediated: Events that have been properly handled. Remediated events do not affect the Cyber Risk Index until a new instance of the event is reported.

The status of XDR detection-related risk events that have an assigned workbench alert can only be changed in Workbench.

Change the status of a risk event to Accepted or Dismissed. In the Mark as Dismissed or Mark as Accepted dialog, select Create event rule for the selected risk event. Click Event rule settings. Select the scope for the new event rule under Apply to. If supported for the risk event type, you may also set additional parameters for the event rule. Event rules with set parameters only apply when the parameters are met. Risk event instances that do not meet rule parameters are still reported, which impacts your Cyber Risk Index.",
