In Risk Overview, view each category's contribution to the Risk Index at a glance, and get additional information about contributing risk factors and events from Risk Event Overview. Go to the tab for each risk category to quickly view the category's current risk level, and see contributing risk factors to more quickly prioritize risk reduction actions.
