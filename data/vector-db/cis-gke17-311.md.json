The kube-proxy kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the kube-proxy service on the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable only by the administrators on the system. Note The default permissions of the proxy kubeconfig file are 644. Impact Overly permissive file permissions increase security risk to the platform. Audit Using Google Cloud Console Go to Kubernetes Engine. Click on the desired cluster to open the Details page, then click on the desired Node pool to open the Node pool Details page. Note the name of the desired node.",

Using Command Line Method 1: SSH to the worker nodes To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running: sudo systemctl status kubelet The output should return Active: active (running) since.... Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate kubeconfig file: ps -ef | grep kubelet The output of the above command should return something similar to --kubeconfig/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig, which is the location of the kubeconfig file. Run this command to obtain the kubeconfig file permissions: stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig The output of the above command gives you the kubeconfig file's permissions.
