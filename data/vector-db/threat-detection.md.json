Trend Micro correlates known threat detections with asset owners to give you better insight into possible security risks. The Threat detection risk factor contributes to your attack level. When viewing risk events, click the number in the case column to view current cases involving the specified risk event. Click the options icon () to open a new case for the risk event or add the case to an existing risk event. Important For customers that have updated to the Foundation Services release, Threat Detections only shows data for devices within the asset visibility scope of the current user. The following table describes the risk indicators associated with the Threat detection risk factor.",
