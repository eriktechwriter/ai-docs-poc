This playbook streamlines the delivery of training campaigns, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. The playbook also allows you to tailor training materials to educate your employees on specific threats and vulnerabilities relevant to your organization. Each execution of the playbook generates a training campaign, which can be tracked in the Training Campaigns app under Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Security Awareness. Each training campaign can be applied to a maximum of 15,000 user accounts. If the risk events target more than 15,000 user accounts, multiple training campaigns will be generated, each containing up to 15,000 users, upon approval.",
