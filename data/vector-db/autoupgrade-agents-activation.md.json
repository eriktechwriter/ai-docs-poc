This feature is especially useful if you want to distribute the agent using the baking process (see Install the agent on an AMI or WorkSpace bundle). When agents are baked it can be difficult for you to update your ‘golden’ images each time a new version of the agent is released. In this case, 'upgrade on activation' can be used so that each time the older agent from the baked image activates, the Server & Workload Protection console instructs the agent to upgrade to the version you specify as part of the activation process keeping the running agents used in your environment up-to-date. Note This feature complies with your agent version control settings.",
