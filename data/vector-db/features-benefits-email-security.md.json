You can specify the senders to allow or block using specific email addresses or entire domains and specify the type of sender addresses collected to match the approved and blocked sender lists. For details, see Managing sender filter. Email Reputation Services Cloud Email Gateway Protection makes use of Trend Micro Email Reputation Services (ERS) Standard Service and Advanced Service. Email Reputation Services use a standard IP reputation database and an advanced and dynamic IP reputation database (a database updated in real time). These databases have distinct entries, allowing Trend Micro to maintain a very efficient and effective system that can quickly respond to new sources of spam.",
