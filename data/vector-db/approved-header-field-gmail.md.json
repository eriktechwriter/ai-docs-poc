If you want certain email messages to skip scanning by all policies, for example, to do a phishing simulation campaign via email, you can create a global approved list so messages that match the header field criteria will not be scanned by all enabled Advanced Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention policies for Gmail and will be delivered to the intended recipients. Procedure In Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, go to Policies → Global Settings → User-Defined Lists → Approved/Blocked Lists, click Gmail, and locate the Approved Header Fields section. Enable the approved header field list for Gmail. You can configure the list first and enable it later when you need to.",
