The tab displays all created simulations, whether the simulations are in progress, completed, cancelled, or scheduled. Click on the name of a simulation to view the simulation details, where you can monitor the simulation. The following table details the actions you can take on the simulation details screen. Action Details View simulation status and details Statuses include: Scheduled: The simulation is pending based on the specified start date Initiating (): The simulation is preparing to start In progress (): The simulation is ongoing Completed (): The simulation is complete and final results are available Cancelled (): The simulation was manually t",
