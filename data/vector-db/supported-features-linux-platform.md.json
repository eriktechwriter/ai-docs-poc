Because embedded operating systems usually run on custom hardware (for example, on point-of-sale terminals), you should thoroughly test your specific hardware platform prior to deployment in a production environment. Trend Micro tests Windows Embedded platforms in a virtualized environment. If you need to raise a case with Trend Micro Support, try to reproduce the problem in a virtualized environment. If the issue cannot be reproduced in a virtualized environment, and is specific to your custom hardware, Trend Micro Support might require you to provide remote access to it for diagnostics.
