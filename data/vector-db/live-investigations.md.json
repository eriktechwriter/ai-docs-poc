Live Investigations can be configured to run at specific periods, and also support a wider set of criteria through the use of OpenIOC and YARA rules. Important Only available for Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents installed on Windows platforms. Live Investigations support the following criteria: OpenIOC rules: Use OpenIOC rules to scan for all files currently on the disk. Note After selection, Endpoint Sensor displays a preview of the OpenIOC file. Review the preview to verify if the OpenIOC file contains supported indicators and conditions. Unsupported combinations are formatted with a strike-through and are ignored during the investigation. For more information, see Supported IOC Indicators for Live Investigations. YARA rules: Use YARA rules to scan all processes currently running in memory.",
