The metrics API service includes endpoints (/metrics and /configz) which disclose information about the configuration and operation of kube-proxy. These endpoints should not be exposed to untrusted networks as they do not support encryption or authentication to restrict access to the data they provide. Note The default value is 127.0.0.1:10249. Impact 3rd party services which try to access metrics or configuration information related to kube-proxy will require access to the localhost interface of the node. Audit Review the start-up flags provided to kube proxy.",
