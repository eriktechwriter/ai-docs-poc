Each GCP VM instance created through a MIG will need to have an agent installed on it. There are two ways that you can do this: you can include a pre-installed agent in the GCP VM instance used to create the instance template, or you can install the agent by including a deployment script in the instance template for the image. There are pros and cons for each option: If you include a pre-installed agent, instances will spin up more quickly because there is no need to download and install the agent software. The downside is that the agent software might not be the latest. To work around this issue, you can enable the upgrade on activation feature.",

Pre-install the agent If you have a GCP VM instance already configured with an agent, you can use that instance to create the instance template for the MIG. Before creating the instance template, you must deactivate the agent on the GCP VM instance and stop the instance: dsa_control -r Each new GCP VM instance created by the MIG needs to have its agent activated and a policy applied to it, if it doesn’t have one already. There are two ways to do this: You can create a deployment script that activates the agent and optionally applies a policy. Then add the deployment script to the GCP instance template so that it is run when a new instance is created. For instructions, see the Install the agent with a deployment script section below, but omit the section of the deployment script that gets and installs the agent.",
