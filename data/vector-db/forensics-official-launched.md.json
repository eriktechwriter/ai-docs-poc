With Forensics, you can respond to security incidents, conduct compromise assessments, threat hunting, and monitoring. Forensics allows you to create workspaces. Within the workspace, you can isolate the scope of an incident and execute osqeury and YARA for quick triage and investigation. If you require more details about an incident, you can collect evidence. Evidence Collection gathers the digital evidence and uploads it to the Trend Vision One console. Forensics offers an evidence viewing and searching function, facilitating advanced investigations. As you progress through the investigation, you can add notes with important timestamps or create customized records in timelines.",
