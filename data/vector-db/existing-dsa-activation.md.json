Activity Monitoring: Enabling Endpoint sensor detection and response on your updated endpoints automatically disables Activity Monitoring on your endpoints. To prevent your agents from disabling Activity Monitoring when updating to the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent, ensure the Endpoint detection & response setting is disabled in the Default Endpoint Policy. For more information about configuring endpoint security policies, see Configure endpoint security policies. Post-update tasks: Verify that your user accounts have the correct access permissions and roles in the new User Account app and resolve any role conflicts. Verify that all your endpoint groups, policies, and system settings updated properly to the Server & Workload Protection and Endpoint Inventory apps.
