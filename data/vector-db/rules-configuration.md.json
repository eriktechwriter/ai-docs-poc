For example, rules that should not be run, their severity, etc. Also, some rules need to be configured to run, while others utilise defaults. Examples of rules that need to be configured before they will run include EC2 Desired Instance Type, Approved/Golden AMIs, Security Group Naming Conventions etc. Once you configure a rule on an account, you can copy the same rule settings to other accounts for which you have administrative privileges or full access. Configurations Disable rule Assign rule severity Time to live (TTL) Set up rule exceptions Disable rule You can disable a rule if required by unchecking Rule enabled. On disabling a rule, all violations will be removed and no more checks will be performed until the rule is re-enabled.",

You could also use regex expressions to configure exceptions. Note: The format of a Resource Id varies depending on the resource type. To check a Resource ID, use the List Checks API. Resource Id Examples: For most AWS resource types, the Resource Id is the ARN. For AWS IAM or S3, the Resource Id matches the resource name. For AWS EC2 and VPC, the Resource Id usually matches the randomly generated Id, e.g. sg-001234d891234abcd. For most Azure resource types, the Resource Id is the full path, e.g. /subscriptions/1234-1234-1234/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.resource/resourceType/my-resource-name. Not all rules support exceptions. Note Please Note: Cloud Risk Management will apply exceptions immediately once you save them.",
