Tags can be used to filter Events in order to simplify the task of Event monitoring and management. A typical use of tagging is to distinguish between Events that require action and those that have been investigated and found to be benign. The data displayed in the Dashboard can be filtered by tags: For more information on tagging see Apply tags to identify and group events.

Note If widgets take up extra space on the dashboard (more than 1x1), their dimensions are listed next to their names.",
