However, when I visit our dashboard and filter by the ACM service I can only see ACM-004.

If they are being checked, is it possible for you to explain why am I unable to see them when filtering by ACM?**Only one of ACM Certificates Renewal rule - 2,3,4 generates a Check at any given time to avoid overlapa.
