Follow the instructions below to migrate endpoints from your Apex One server to Standard Endpoint Protection with the IPXfer tool. Important The IPXfer tool can only move one agent at a time and you must have administrator access to the endpoint device where the agent is installed. To move more than one agent at a time, see Migrating Agents with the Apex One Server Console. Note After moving agents to Standard Endpoint Protection, you cannot move them back to Apex One Server using the Trend Vision One console. If you need to move agents from Trend Vision One, you must use the IPXfer tool. When moving agents using this method, the agents automatically inherit the settings of the parent group or domain. They do not retain their settings from the source Trend Micro Apex One server.",
