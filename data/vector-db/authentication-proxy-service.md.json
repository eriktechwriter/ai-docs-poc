To ensure users can log in from both public or home networks and private networks, please enable only NTLM authentication and disable Kerberos authentication.",

The service runs within the DMZ between firewalls, which allows users access for authentication whether the users are connecting from the corporate intranet (user A in the above diagram), or from a public or home network (user B in the above diagram). The service retrieves settings and data from Trend Vision One via HTTPS through port 443 on firewall A. Once configured, the authentication proxy service allows end users to reach your Active Directory server from endpoints under the following scenarios.",
