Important This is a \"Pre-release\" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-release disclaimer before using the feature. Note This feature is not available in all regions. If you would like access to this pre-release feature, contact your sales representative. Internet-facing assets are inherently risky. Assets such as internet-facing domains and IP addresses constitute a large portion of your organization's attack surface and are among the first targets attackers attempt to compromise. Misconfigurations detected on your internet-facing assets contribute significantly to your Cyber Risk Index.",

    "content": "The events are critical to detect and address as soon as possible to reduce the likelihood of a successful attack. You may perform on-demand scans of select internet-facing assets to detect exposures, including system configuration issues. On-demand scanning uses the Network Vulnerability Scanner service installed on a Service Gateway virtual appliance deployed to a public cloud platform. On-demand scans allow you to detect internet-facing asset exposures faster and conduct more proactive mitigation actions. Important The following limitations and requirements apply to on-demand internet-facing asset scanning: Internet-facing asset scans are only available when using Trend Micro solutions for internet-facing asset discovery. Scans are not supported if you are only using a third-party product for asset discovery. Service Gateways used for scanning must be deployed to a public cloud platform such as AWS or Microsoft Azure and running in order to successfully scan external assets.",

Service Gateways used for scanning must have the Network Vulnerability Scanner service enabled and updated to version 1.0.1 or later. If necessary, you can update the Network Vulnerability Scanner service in Service Gateway Management. Root domains and IPv6 addresses are not currently supported for scanning. Only five assets can be scanned at a time, and only one scan can run at a time per supported Service Gateway. If you need to scan more assets, wait approximately 30 minutes for the scan to complete and then start a new scan. You can trigger an on-demand internet-facing asset scan from the following locations in the Trend Vision One console. Location Procedure Attack Surface Discovery → Internet-facing assets → Domains → Domain list Select up to five subdomains and click Scan for exposures.",
