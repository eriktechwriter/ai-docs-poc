Important For accurate analysis, configure your Network Resource Lists in Network Security → Network Analysis Configuration → Network Resources. Configuring Network Resource Lists provides the Network Analytics engine with context about the topography of your security environment. You can configure multiple Network Resource profiles for more granular detail, especially if you monitor multiple networks or company branches from your Trend Vision One console. The network analytics report is available for all apps that use Network Sensors as a data source, including Virtual Network Sensor, TippingPoint, and Deep Discovery Inspector. The network analytics report shows network correlations between the trigger object selected in Observable Graph and other related objects.",
