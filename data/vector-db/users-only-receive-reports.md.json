Contacts can be assigned a \"clearance\" level that maps to existing roles. When a contact is sent a report, the report will contain only information that would be accessible to a user of the same level. For example, three contacts may be listed as the recipients of a weekly summary report, but the contents of the three reports could be entirely different for each contact depending on their computer rights. Note Most users are managed through Trend Micro Cloud One User Management, which applies to all parts of Trend Micro Cloud One, but contacts are managed specifically through Server & Workload Protection.",
