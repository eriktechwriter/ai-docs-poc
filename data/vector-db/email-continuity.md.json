If a planned or unplanned outage occurs, Cloud Email Gateway Protection will keep your incoming email messages for 10 days. Once your email server is back online within the 10-day period, these messages will be restored to your email server. A continuity mailbox is available instantly and automatically, providing end users the ability to read, forward, download and reply to any email messages. This enables end users to have continued email access during an outage without requiring any action from IT. In fact, Cloud Email Gateway Protection will scan the email messages sent from the continuity mailbox based on its default outbound policy.",
