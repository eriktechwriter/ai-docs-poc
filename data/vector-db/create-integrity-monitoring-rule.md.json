Integrity Monitoring rules can be assigned directly to computers or can be made part of a policy. Note This topic specifically covers how to create an Integrity Monitoring rule. For information on how to configure the Integrity Monitoring module, see Set up integrity monitoring. There are two types of Integrity Monitoring rules: those that you have created, and those that are issued by Trend Micro. For more information on how to configure rules issued by Trend Micro, see the Configure Trend Micro integrity monitoring rules section. To create a new Integrity Monitoring rule, you need to: Procedure Add a new rule.",
