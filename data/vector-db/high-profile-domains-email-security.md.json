A cousin domain (or look-alike domain) is a domain that looks deceptively similar to a legitimate target domain, which is well-known or familiar to users. Cousin domains are often used in phishing attacks to steal sensitive or confidential information from users. Cousin domains are usually created by replacing one or more characters (for example, replacing the letter \"l\" with the number \"1\") or adding or removing an extra character in the domain name. Without careful inspection of the email addresses, users may not notice the trick and think that an email message is sent from a legitimate domain being forged.",
