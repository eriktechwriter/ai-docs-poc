Important Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection protects the Teams and Chat services in Microsoft Teams separately. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection does not protect the messages and files in the chats that users have with themselves. As Microsoft's licensing models for Teams APIs impose usage restrictions and licensing requirements on API calls, you need to use your own app registered with Microsoft Entra ID and select an applicable licensing model when granting access to Teams Chat. For details about the licensing models, see Microsoft Documentation.",

Private chat files are stored in the sender's OneDrive folder. If you have also granted Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to OneDrive, when the user sending or uploading a file is selected as a policy target respectively, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection applies the corresponding policies for Teams Chat and for OneDrive to this file.
