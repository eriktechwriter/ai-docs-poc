Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection is a serverless function enabled in your connected cloud accounts. The function scans supported cloud resources for vulnerabilities and malware without impact to other resources or running applications. The function only activates during a scan and scales dynamically to meet the needs of the scanning process within a set resource limit. All collected data is analyzed within the serverless function, and only metadata is sent to Trend Vision One. Your data does not leave your cloud account. Important Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection takes snapshots of your cloud storage resources prior to scanning and tags the snapshots with the tag trend-micro-product:avtd.",

Snapshots are automatically deleted from your cloud account after the scan completes. Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection currently supports the following cloud providers: AWS Google Cloud Microsoft Azure Vulnerability scanning inspects your cloud resources for known CVEs. Anti-malware scanning scans your cloud resources to identify potential malware, including viruses, Trojans, spyware, and more. Scans occur once per day, starting when you first connect your cloud account and enable the feature. Scan times are not configurable after deployment. Note Anti-malware scanning is not enabled for AWS accounts by default. After enabling the feature, anti-malware scans begin during the next daily scan. Scan results are sent to Trend Vision One for review.",
