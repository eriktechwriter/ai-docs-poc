Predictive Machine Learning is a powerful tool that helps protect your environment from unidentified threats and zero-day attacks. After detecting an unknown or low-prevalence file, Cloud Email Gateway Protection scans the file using the Advanced Threat Scan Engine to extract file features and sends the report to the Predictive Machine Learning engine. Through use of malware modeling, Predictive Machine Learning compares the sample to the malware model, assigns a probability score, and determines the probable malware type that the file contains.
