Each object in the array is one event. Valid properties vary by the type of event. For example, MajorVirusType is a valid property only for Server & Workload Protection Anti-Malware events, not system events etc. Valid property values vary for each property. For examples, see Example events in JSON format. Event property values can be used to filter which events are published to the SNS topic. For details, see SNS configuration in JSON format. Valid event properties Note Some events don't have all of the properties that usually apply to their event type. Property Name Data Type Description Applies To Event Type(s) ACRulesetID Integer The unique identifier of the Application Control Ruleset applied to the computer where the event was detected.",
