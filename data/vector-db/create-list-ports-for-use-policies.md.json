A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each created in a different rule. Tip To create a port list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it. Individual ports and port ranges can be included on the list, for example 80, and 20-21. You can insert comments into your port list by preceding the text with a pound sign (\"#\"). Note For a listing commonly accepted port number assignments, see the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For a list of port numbers used by Server & Workload Protection, relay, or agents, see Server & Workload Protection Port numbers. Procedure Click Policies → Common Objects → Lists → Port Lists. Click New → New Port List. Type a name and, optionally, a description.",
