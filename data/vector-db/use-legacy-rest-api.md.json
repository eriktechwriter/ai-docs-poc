Basic API access All access to the REST API is made through the REST API endpoint: https://app.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/rest. Because the REST API uses standard HTTP mechanisms and some of the operations can be accessed without authentication using HTTP GET, these methods can be accessed from a web browser. For example, the following URL returns the REST API version to the browser: https://dsm.example.com:4119/rest/apiVersion However, most REST API calls require authentication. To authenticate calls, you provide a session identifier (SID) either as a query parameter for GET and DELETE methods or in the message body of PUT and POST methods.",
