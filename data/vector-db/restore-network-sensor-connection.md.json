Important Before you begin, make verify the Virtual Network Sensor can successfully connect using a supported connection method: Direct connection Custom proxy Service Gateway as a proxy Procedure Hover your mouse over the Unhealthy status to view more information about the status. Click the link to try connecting your sensor again. The Restore Sensor Connection window appears. Select the Connection method. Direct connection: the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One directly. Make sure the Virtual Network Sensor is able to connect to the internet when using this configuration.",

You cannot retrieve the connection token after closing the Restore Sensor Connection window. You must click Save to update the connection information in your Trend Vision One console. Leaving the screen without saving discards the connection token. You cannot restore a connection with an unsaved connection token. Access the Virtual Network Sensor command line interface (CLI). To enable administrative commands, type enable. Run the command switch-connection-method [connection_token]. Replace the value [connection_token] with the connection token you copied from Network Inventory. The connection restoration process might take a few moments to complete. Once the process successfully completes, the Virtual Network Sensor reestablishes the connection with Trend Vision One. You can view the status by refreshing the Network Inventory screen.",
