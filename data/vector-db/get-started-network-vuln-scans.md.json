Important This is a \"Pre-release\" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-release disclaimer before using the feature. To configure scans in Network Vulnerability Scanner, you need: A deployed Service Gateway virtual appliance with the Network Vulnerability Scanner service version 1.1.0 or later installed IP addresses or FQDNs for the target network segment for vulnerability and discovery scans or target assets for external attack surface scans Authentication credentials for the target network assets for vulnerability scans Available scan templates include: Discovery scan: Identifies live hosts, open ports, and basic system information within a network segment Helps security teams map out t",
