Identity Inventory provides a centralized location to view information about the identities, both human and non-human, and the entitlements used across your organization. Trend Vision One leverages your connected identity providers (IdP), such as Microsoft Entra ID, to allow you to review and monitor user and group privileges and access policies. The increased visibility helps you quickly identify policy misconfigurations and overprivileged identities and strengthen your security posture. To enable all of the features available in Identity Inventory, you must grant specific read and write permissions from your connected identity provider.
