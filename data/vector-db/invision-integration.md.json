This integration allows Invision to retrieve report data from Trend Vision One to generate the Invision Insights Report. The report provides a snapshot of key elements of your cyber risk posture, helping Invision quickly and accurately assess your risk to offer appropriate, competitive insurance terms for your business. Through this integration, you can generate a secure API key to share with Invision during your insurance application process, which Invision can use to access the report data only. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, obtain the endpoint URL and authentication token. Go to Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration. Click Invision. Click to copy and save the Endpoint URL. Copy and save the Authentication token.",
