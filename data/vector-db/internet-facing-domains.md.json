Attack Surface Discovery identifies your internet-facing domains, subdomains, and hosts using your connected identity and access management (IAM) systems and Trend Vision One sign-on information. You may also add domains manually either by choosing from a suggested list or by entering specific domains. Domains undergo a secondary verification process before appearing in Internet-Facing Assets. Data for internet-facing domains is updated daily. Important It may take up to 10 days for added or removed domains to be reflected in the domains list. The following table explains the usage of domain-related terms in Internet-Facing Assets.",
