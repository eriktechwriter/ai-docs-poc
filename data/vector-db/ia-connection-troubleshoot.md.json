Internet Access Diagnostics is a browser-based tool that collects troubleshooting information for endpoints when they connect to the internet through the Internet Access Gateway. To identify internet connectivity and latency issues between the endpoint, the Internet Access Gateway, and the destination website, instruct your end user to follow these instruction to access Internet Access Diagnostics and provide the debug log to you or your support provider. Note Trend Micro recommends you use the Internet Access Diagnostics rather than other third-party test tools to avoid introducing extra latency or variables that affect troubleshooting.
