Depending on the type of container, direct response actions are available throughout the Trend Vision One console (for example, on the Workbench, Observed Attack Techniques, and Search apps) that you can then track using Response Management. Important Before Kubernetes isolation is available, you must ensure that you have a network policy deployed on your cluster. By default, Container Security continuous compliance creates a Kubernetes network policy but you can manually create a Kubernetes network policy for continuous compliance.",
