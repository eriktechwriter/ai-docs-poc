Managing multiple service provider tenants, for example, Microsoft Entra ID tenants, can be challenging. It often results in an incomplete and inconsistent view of service data and users over the corporate network. By introducing organization management, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection enables you to use one single CLP, LMP, or local account to manage and visualize the security posture across all your tenants' services, which could be done only by switching among multiple CLP accounts before.",

The steps outlined below illustrate how to use this feature across the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection management console. Procedure Log on to the Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection management console. A default organization is automatically created. If you do not need more organizations, you can grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to and protect all your cloud services under this default organization. Add organizations if you decide to have more, for example, if you have two Microsoft Entra ID tenants to manage. For more information, see Organization management.",
