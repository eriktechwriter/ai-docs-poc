The Predictive analytics risk factor is based on exposures detected on your assets that could potentially facilitate an attack in the future. The predictive analytics risk factor contributes to your exposure level. Generated risk events can be viewed and managed in Threat and Exposure Management. When viewing risk events, click the number in the case column to view current cases involving the specified risk event. Click the options icon () to open a new case for the risk event or add the case to an existing risk event. Important Addressing attack path risk events does not necessarily address the root cause of the risk.",
