For more information, see APIs. Note The Manage assets permission in Attack Surface Discovery is required for integration with Kong Gateway. Trend Vision One will create an API key with the Operator role, which includes this permission. You can change this role to a more restrictive role if needed. The Trend Vision One Kong Gateway integration supports Kong Gateway OSS or Enterprise version 2.71 or later. To complete the configuration, you must contact your Trend Vision One account manager for access to the plugin and instructions for installing it. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, generate the API key to authenticate with Kong Gateway. Go to Third-Party Integration. Select Kong Gateway. Click Generate.",
