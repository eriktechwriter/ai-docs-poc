Deploying this feature gives you actionable insights into risky or malicious endpoint activities. Detection models identify behaviors such as malware execution, suspicious file modifications, lateral movement attempts, and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Log Collection offers both Cyber Risk Exposure Management and XDR capabilities: Cyber Risk Exposure Management is automatically enabled when you deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Log Collection in an Azure subscription. Trend Vision One collects DeviceInfo and DeviceNetworkInfo events and sends them to Cyber Risk Exposure Management, where you can view security configuration risk events.",
