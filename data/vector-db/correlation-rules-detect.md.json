Procedure Go to Policies → Global Settings → Correlated Intelligence → Correlation Rules and Detection Signals. Click Correlation Rules to view the predefined and custom rules used by Correlated Intelligence for anomaly detection. On the Correlation Rules tab, click a rule name to view details about a predefined rule or modify a custom rule. Trend Micro defines a set of correlation rules and detection signals, and continually introduces new rules and signals. Each predefined rule consists of one or multiple predefined detection signals. View the details about a rule to understand what the rule is about, what detection signals are used, and how the rule is matched.",

    "content": "Trend Micro classifies its predefined correlation rules for anomaly detection into three aggressive levels: Moderate, Aggressive, and Extra aggressive. Moderate: This level is designed to seek a balance between effective anomaly detection and maintaining a relatively low rate of false positives. It is suitable for everyday monitoring and for customers who prefer a safer approach without significant disruptions to their regular email flow. Aggressive: This level increases the sensitivity of anomaly detection and offers a more robust detection capability, which may result in a higher number of false positives. It is tailored for customers who require more stringent security measures to combat sophisticated attacks and are willing to accept some trade-offs in false alerts. Extra aggressive: This highest level of aggression is recommended for critical situations, such as during an active attack or after a security breach has been identified.",
