The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kube-scheduler service in the master node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Note By default, kube-scheduler.yaml file ownership is set to root:root. Audit Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml Verify that the ownership is set to root:root. Remediation Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.",
