Procedure Go to Mobile Security → Mobile Security Policies. On the Android or iOS/PadOS tab, click Create. Under General, specify the policy name and description, set the priority of the policy, and click Next. The Priority has two options: Highest: Select this to make the policy a top priority. It will be evaluated before all other policies. Lowest: Select this if the policy should be a lower priority. It will be evaluated after all other policies, with the exception of the default policy. The default policy is always the last to be evaluated regardless of other settings. If you set a policy to Lowest, the policy will be evaluated just before the default policy. Tip After the policy is created, you can change the priority by dragging the policy up or down the policy list.",
