Select Detect connections using malware network fingerprinting to enable the feature. Configure the Monitoring Level settings for Detection and Prevention. Important Higher monitoring levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends selecting 2 - Moderate for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints. The Prevention level must be the same or lower than Detection. The Threats to block selection might affect the prevention actions taken for the selected prevention level. Select the Action to take. Log only: Record the event and take no action.
