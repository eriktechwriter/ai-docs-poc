You can configure Network Resource profiles to provide different sets of Network Resource lists for your network asset groups. Network Resource profiles enable tailoring specific network information to your deployed Network Sensors based on location, region, or other factors which require you to define different network topographies. Use the following steps to create and configure a Network Resource profile. Important Configure network asset lists from Network Inventory. For more information, see Network Inventory. If you have not created a Network Resource profile, Network Resources displays only the Base Profile. The Base Profile is applied to all network asset groups which have not been assigned to another profile.",

Assigning a network asset group to a new profile overwrites the Network Resource information for the assigned Network Sensors. Always back up your Network Resource Lists using the export function before assigning new profiles. For more information, see Network Resource Lists.
