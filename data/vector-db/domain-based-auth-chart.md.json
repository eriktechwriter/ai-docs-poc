Sender IP Match is a way that readily enables you to simultaneously allow all inbound email traffic from a particular domain while equally preventing spoofing by manually defining the allowed IP ranges. SPF, DKIM and DMARC are three email authentication systems to protect against email spoofing. Note The data on this tab is displayed for incoming mail traffic only. Select a time period by Date, Week, Month, or Last 12 months to show data for the selected time period.",
