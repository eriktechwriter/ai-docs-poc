For more information, see Best practices for upgrades. Upgrade a relay from Server & Workload Protection Procedure Log in to the Server & Workload Protection console. Identify your relays byt doing one of the following: Go to Computers. In the main pane, look for computers with the relay icon (). Go to Administration. On the left, click Updates → Relay Management. In the main pane, expand a Relay Group. Your relays are displayed with the relay icon (). Double-click the relay that you want to upgrade. Click the Actions tab. Click Upgrade Agent.
