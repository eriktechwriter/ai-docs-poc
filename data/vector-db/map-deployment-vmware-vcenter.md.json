Use these maps to help guide your deployment plans to best meet the needs of your network. Each scenario contains a link to the post-deployment network configuration steps for the mapped configuration. To monitor network traffic within the host machine the Virtual Network Sensor is deployed on, see Internal network traffic scenarios. To monitor network traffic between virtual machines deployed on a different host machine than the Virtual Network Sensor, see External inter-VM traffic scenarios.
