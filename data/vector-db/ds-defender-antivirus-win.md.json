When you install Deep Security with the AM enabled on a Windows 10 or 11 desktop, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is automatically set to the passive mode. On a Windows Server, you need to re-enable the AM policy (Disable > Enable) to let Microsoft Defender Antivirus enter passive mode. Note If you disable the DSA AM, either by deactivating or uninstalling it, it removes both the DisableAntiSpyware and ForceDefenderPassiveMode registry in Microsoft Defender Antivirus: The DisableAntiSpyware registry key specifies whether or not to disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus. By removing it, you remove the disable key, therefore enabling Microsoft Defender Antivirus. You may have to enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus manually to ensure it is in active mode.",
