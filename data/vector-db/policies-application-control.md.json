Procedure To protect your endpoints with Application Control, select Enable. Note When you enable Application Control, the rule list might be filtered by Active status and might appear empty. Change the Status filter to All to view the Application Control rules. To only allow previously installed applications on the endpoint to run and block all others, select Enable under Lockdown mode. Important Lockdown mode strictly blocks any software which might alter the software running on your endpoint. Enabling lockdown mode might block essential functions like Windows Update and the agent uninstaller tool. For more information, see Prepare for Lockdown Mode.",
