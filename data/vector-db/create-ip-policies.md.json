A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each defined in a different rule. Tip To create an IP list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it. You can enter an individual IP address, or you can enter IP ranges and masked IPs. You can also insert comments into your IP list by preceding the text with a hash sign (\"#\"). Masked IP examples are 192.168.0/24, 192.168.2.0/255.255.255.0, and for IPV6 2001:0DB8::CD30:0:0:0:0/60. IP range examples are 192.168.0.2 - 192.168.0.125 and, for IPV6, FF01::101 - FF01::102 Procedure Click Policies → Common Objects → Lists → IP Lists. Click New → New IP List. Type a name and, optionally, a description.",

For example, you can ensure no firewall rules use an IP list before deleting it. Procedure Click Policies → Common Objects → Lists → IP Lists. Select the IP list and click Properties.
