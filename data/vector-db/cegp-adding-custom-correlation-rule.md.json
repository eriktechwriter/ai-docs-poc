Procedure On the Correlation Rules tab, click Add. Specify a name for the rule and optionally provide a description in the Basic Properties area. The name can help clearly identify what anomaly you want to detect. Define one or multiple statements that comprise the rule. A statement combines detection signals and the AND operator. Select a detection signal type from the drop-down list to filter out the available signals, and then select a desired signal from the next drop-down list. If you need one more signals to comprise the statement, click Add Signal. Repeat the previous step to add more signals to the statement. Click the icon to remove a signal if it is not needed. When the statement definition is completed, click Add Statement to Rule.",
