Create custom detection models that use the new custom filters to trigger the generation of custom Observed Attack Techniques events and Workbench alerts. The custom Observed Attack Techniques events and Workbench alerts are accessible by several downstream features and services, including the Observed Attack Techniques app, the Workbench public API, widgets, and third-party SIEM integrations. In addition, the new custom detection models can be leveraged by the Security Playbooks app to create automated response actions.
