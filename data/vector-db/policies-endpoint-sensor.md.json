Important Policies are \"Pre-release\" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-Release Disclaimer before using the feature. This feature is not available in all regions. Enabling Endpoint Sensor requires allocating credits for each endpoint assigned to the policy. Navigating between the security modules or leaving the Policy Settings screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click Save before leaving the current screen. To enhance blocking of URLs and domains added to your suspicious objects list, enable the browser extension on your endpoints.

    "content": "Monitoring level is the degree of vigilance and strictness applied when detecting and responding to potential threats. Higher monitoring levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends setting your monitoring level to 2 - Moderate for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints. To allow the agent to analyze video calls to detect possible deepfake audio and images, select Enable for Deepfake detector. Important Deepfake detector only supports Windows deployments.
