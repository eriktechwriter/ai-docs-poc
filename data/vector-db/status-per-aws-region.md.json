The colour of the dots on each region indicate the level of risk due to rule failures against resources in the region, varying from dark red for low compliance score to green for high compliance score. Your organisation might have AWS infrastructure in several regions. Using the map, you can identify the regions that are the most vulnerable and take remedial actions accordingly. Clicking on the highlighted dots will display the compliance score and severity level breakdown of failures for that region.",
