Starting from TippingPoint SMS 6.1.0, connecting a TippingPoint SMS to Trend Vision One no longer requires the use of a Service Gateway. An internal service enables TippingPoint SMS to automatically establish and maintain a connection to Trend Vision One with an enrollment token. The connection can also be established through an HTTP proxy if the TippingPoint SMS does not have a direct internet connection. Important Intrusion Prevention Configuration currently only supports policy enforcement on the first TippingPoint SMS connected to Trend Vision One. Support for policy enforcement on multiple TippingPoint SMS deployments is coming soon.",
