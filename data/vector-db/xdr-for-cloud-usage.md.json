XDR for Cloud requires credits when enabled for your cloud accounts. The initial credit requirement is calculated based on your specified usage reservation, or how many GB of data you estimate your organization will upload to Trend Vision One over the year. If your actual usage exceeds the usage reservation, the credits allocated to XDR for Cloud are automatically increased. For more information on the credit allocation model for XDR for Cloud, see Credit allocation models. XDR for Cloud includes the following features: Cloud Detections for AWS CloudTrail Cloud Detections for AWS VPC Flow Logs Cloud Detections for Amazon Security Lake Before enabling XDR for Cloud features and deploying the stack template, consider the following recommendations when estimating how many GB of data to alloca",

Use this past usage information to estimate your future data usage. Compressed data: AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Security Lake data logs are stored in compressed format in the AWS console. When analyzed in Trend Vision One for XDR Threat Detections, the data is uncompressed. To account for this, Trend Micro recommends allocating 8 to 10 times more data usage in Trend Vision One than the size shown in AWS. For example, if the S3 bucket storing your data is 10 GB in size in the AWS console, you should allocate credits for 80 to 100 GB of data usage over the year in Trend Vision One.",
