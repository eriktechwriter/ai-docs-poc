To add a CIDR block to the list, type the IPv4 address / CIDR block. The following is the only valid format: x.x.x.x/z These lists override the Quick IP List and Standard IP Reputation Settings and allow for customization of which addresses are subjected to IP reputation-based filtering. The IP addresses in the approved lists bypass other IP reputation-based filtering as well as reverse DNS validation.",
