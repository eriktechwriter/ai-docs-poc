The file's extension identifies the file type. Similarly, specific attacks often associate with a specific file name. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection can block files according to the file type, file name, file extension, or file contents that contain suspicious URLs. For email services, file blocking prevents email messages containing suspicious attachments from delivering to recipients. Policy actions include replacing the file with a benign text file, quarantining or deleting all email messages with attachments that violate specified policies, or labeling the violating email messages as risky in recipient's mailbox (Gmail only). For the other cloud applications, file blocking prevents suspicious files from entering these applications.",
