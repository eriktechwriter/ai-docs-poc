Click Download Virtual Appliance. The Service Gateway Virtual Appliance panel appears. Select Microsoft Hyper-V (VHD). Select a virtual appliance specification and click Download Disk Image to download an VHD file in a compressed archive. Tip Copy the registration token for later steps. The registration token will expire within 24 hours if not used. Extract the VHD file using a ZIP extractor. Create a virtual machine. On Hyper-V Manager, right-click on your machine and New → Virtual Machine. Click Next.",
