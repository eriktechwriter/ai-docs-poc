Trend Vision One app assets are the settings that the administrators configure and manage in the Trend Vision One console, for example, scheduled playbooks in the Security Playbooks app and custom reports in the Reports app.\n\nLarge-sized customers that run multiple businesses or have the need to segregate asset data visibility for different teams can leverage this capability to achieve granular data visibility and multi-tenancy management purposes within a single Trend Vision One console.",

For more information about creating a custom user role, see [User Roles](user-roles-foundation-services.md).\n\nFor example, users having a user role with a specified endpoint visibility scope can view the data of endpoints within their responsibility in not only Endpoint Security Operations but also Search and Cyber Risk Exposure Management, and take actions on these assets if having necessary permissions.",
