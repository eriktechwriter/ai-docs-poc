Follow the instructions below to connect your Trend Micro Apex One as a Service or Trend Micro Apex Central on-premises products to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security and move selected endpoints from your Trend Micro Apex One server to Standard Endpoint Protection. Note After moving agents to Standard Endpoint Protection, you cannot move them back to Trend Micro Apex One as a Service or Trend Micro Apex Central using the Trend Vision One console. If you need to move agents from Trend Vision One, you must use the IPXfer tool. Agents inherit the settings of the target server. Procedure To copy your current endpoint policies, export Trend Micro Apex One security agent policies to Standard Endpoint Protection.",
