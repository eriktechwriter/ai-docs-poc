It does this by validating the connecting console's certificate path and ensuring it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). If the certificate path is validated, the console authentication passes and activates the agents. This prevents agents from activating with a malicious server pretending to be Server & Workload Protection. To protect your agents, you must configure each agent so it can recognize its authorized manager before the agent tries to activate: Procedure Go to Sectigo Intermediate Certificates - RSA.
