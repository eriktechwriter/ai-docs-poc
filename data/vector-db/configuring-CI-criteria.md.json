Designed to empower you with enhanced detection capabilities against sophisticated attacks, Correlated Intelligence correlates suspicious signals from various sources to detect phishing security risks and anomalies. Note Correlated Intelligence is available for Inbound Protection only. Correlated Intelligence collects signals from Virus Scan and Spam Filtering. One key advantage of Correlated Intelligence is the capability to see and analyze signals from multiple sources to identify phishing security risks that may go unnoticed by a single security filter. This multi-source approach adds an extra layer of protection to detect potential threats.",

Anomalies may not necessarily indicate a security risk, but are unusual enough to warrant attention. With this feature, you can have a more comprehensive view of your security landscape. Correlated Intelligence operates by first gathering detection signals from various security criteria and then matching the signals against the predefined correlation rules. The aim of this process is to identify any matches that could indicate a phishing security risk or anomaly, providing a more thorough and nuanced analysis of potential security threats. Cloud Email Gateway Protection comes with a set of predefined correlation rules and detection signals to detect Trend Micro specified security risks and anomalies.",
