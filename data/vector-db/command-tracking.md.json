For example, after issuing a Start Scan Now task, which can take several minutes to complete, you can proceed with other tasks and then refer to the Command Tracking screen to query and view the status of the issued command. For more information about querying and viewing commands, see Querying and Viewing Commands. The following table describes the command information that displays on the Command Tracking screen.",
