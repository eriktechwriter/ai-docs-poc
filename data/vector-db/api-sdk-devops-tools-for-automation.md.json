The SDK includes a Python package that makes it easy to use the API in Python. The API Reference provides information about each resource that you interact with: Descriptions of operations that you can perform on each resource (GET, POST, etc) Request paths, headers, and payloads Example requests and response messages Guides, such as this one, describe how to use the SDKs via examples of how to automate",

    "content": "typical Server & Workload Protection operational tasks. API versions The API is versioned. Each request that you make must include the version to use in the api-version header. The first version is v1. Although new versions are rarely released, you must ensure that the API version you are using is compatible with Server & Workload Protection. However, Server & Workload Protection is backward-compatible with all versions of the API. For example, if your code uses the v1 API and you upgrade the manager, your code behavior does not change. However, you should always use the latest available version of the API. Legacy REST and SOAP APIs Note The REST and SOAP APIs that were provided before Deep Security 11.1 have not changed. They have been deprecated, so new features will not be added but the existing API functionality will continue to function as usual. Server & Workload Protection still includes the legacy Deep Security REST and SOAP APIs.",
