Important Throughput is calculated as the sum of all data ports. If your deployment requires multiple data ports, add the additional data ports after powering off the deployed Virtual Network Sensor. If your throughput is less than 2 Gbps, your ERSPAN data port configuration can use a vSphere Distributed Switch, a vSphere Standard Switch, or a PCI passthrough. If your throughput is equal to or greater than 2 Gbps, using a PCI passthrough is recommended. Your data port must be able to connect to the internet. To determine which deployment scenario is best for your network security needs, see Map your deployment with VMware vCenter.",
