Some integrations that Trend Vision One supports, including the AWS S3 bucket connector, Splunk HEC connector, and the Datalake Pipeline APIs in the API Automation Center, allow you to transfer XDR activity data from Trend Vision One for data analysis or regulatory compliance and auditing purposes. Data transfer to third-party platforms requires 800 credits per terabyte of transferred XDR activity data per year. You can set a data allowance in the credit settings in Third-Party Integration based on your projected volume and duration of data transfer use.",

Refer to the below sections for answers to more questions about data transfer in Trend Vision One. How do I estimate the data allowance I should set per year? Currently, the best way to estimate your likely annual data transfer use is to run a short proof-of-concept using your connected products. Extrapolate your projected annual use by checking the volume of data transferred in Usage Details in the Third-Party Integration credit settings. Can I export historical data? Only data that has been generated after you have configured the relevant third-party product integration is streamed and transferred. What data types require credits for data transfer? Only activity data requires credits. Detection logs, Observed Attack Techniques events, and Workbench alerts do not require credit allocation for transfer.",

    "content": "Do I need to allocate additional credits to send data to multiple third-party products? If you need to transfer the same data to multiple destinations, even in the same product, you need to allocate credits per destination. For example, transferring data to three different AWS S3 buckets requires three times the credit allocation. If you need to reduce your credit usage, consider transferring the data to one destination in the product and then distributing the data within that product's environment. Can I allocate less than 1 TB of data per year? While data transfer in Usage Details is displayed in GB, the minimum credit allocation is per TB. Data transfer requires at least 1TB allocated for use. Can I transfer activity data without allocating credits? Activity data transfer is disabled if you do not have credits for at least 1 TB allocated.",

    "content": "How is data volume measured for outbound data transfer in Third-Party Integration? Data transfer volume in Third-Party Integration is based on the volume of data stored in Trend Vision One, unlike Agentic SIEM, which uses the raw volume of data collected to measure data ingestion and retention. How do I transfer data to a SIEM or other product that doesn’t have an existing integration in Third-Party Integration? If you need to transfer data to a product that doesn’t have an existing integration, consider using the APIs in the API Automation Center to facilitate data transfer. The credit requirements for using the API to pull data are the same as other data transfer-related integrations in Third-Party Integration. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
