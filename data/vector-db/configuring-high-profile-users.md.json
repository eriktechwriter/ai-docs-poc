Specify the email display names and optionally email addresses of the high profile users who might be frequently impersonated. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection uses the High Profile Users list for the following: Check incoming email messages claimed to be sent from those users, apply fraud checking criteria to identify forged messages, and enable you to take action if BEC attacks are detected. Allow you to directly take action when the display name of an external sender matches the list. Important High Profile Users apply to all BEC detection technologies used by Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection.",

As a global setting, the specified high profile users are applicable to all Advanced Spam Protection enabled policies for your email service, that is, Exchange Online or Gmail, for BEC detection. For details, see Configuring Advanced Spam Protection. Note Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports configuring a High Profile User Exception list to skip the scanning for BEC even when a sender's display name matches the High Profile Users list. For details, see Configuring high profile user exception list. Procedure In Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, go to Policies → Global Settings → User-Defined Lists → High Profile List and click High Profile Users. Perform the following tasks: Specify individual users or select users from groups as high profile users. Note A maximum of 1,000 users can be added.",
