Under Enable Web Reputation on the following operating systems, select the types of Windows platforms to protect (Windows desktop platforms and Windows Server platforms). Tip Trend Micro recommends disabling Web Reputation for internal agents if you already use a Trend Micro product with the web reputation capability, such as InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance.
