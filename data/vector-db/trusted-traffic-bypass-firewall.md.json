To configure this, the basic steps are as follows: Create a new IP list of trusted traffic sources Create incoming and outbound firewall rules for trusted traffic using the IP list Assign the firewall rules to a policy used by computers that trusted traffic flows through After the firewall rules have been assigned to a policy, Server & Workload Protection will allow traffic from trusted sources in the IP list and will not scan the traffic for stateful issues or vulnerabilities. Create a new IP list of trusted traffic sources Click Policies. In the left pane, click Lists → IP Lists. Click New → New IP List. Enter a name for the IP list. Paste the IP addresses for your trusted sources into the IP(s) box, one per line. Click OK.",
