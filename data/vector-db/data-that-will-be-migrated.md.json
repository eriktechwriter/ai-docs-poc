Among the settings that are partially migrated, some are modified to adapt to Cloud Email Gateway Protection due to the feature differences between IMSS or IMSVA and Cloud Email Gateway Protection. Therefore, you need to confirm or fix these settings according to the on-screen instructions after migration. The following table lists some examples of the settings that will be partially migrated and describes the feature differences. Note For details about all the settings that are completely or partially migrated, see the data migration report downloaded from the Cloud Email Gateway Protection administrator console when the migration completes.",
