Intrusion Prevention Configuration centralizes insights from across your network and assesses and prioritizes risk alongside other XDR sensor data. Intrusion Prevention Configuration provides policy recommendations and enables the deployment of virtual patch filters to stay ahead of critical CVEs. Note Intrusion Prevention Configuration was formerly known as Network Intrusion Prevention - Policy Recommendations. You can view your connected TippingPoint devices by navigating to Network Security → Network Inventory. Policy recommendations speed up your response to the most critical CVE threats affecting your network through the deployment of available TippingPoint Security Management System (SMS) virtual patch filters.",

If you have more than one SMS, use the dropdown menu to select which SMS to display for policy tuning. Information and policy configuration options for the SMS you select is displayed on the Policy Recommendations page. Note In order for TippingPoint users to see Intrusion Prevention Data, they must first ensure Vulnerabilities is selected as a Risk Factor in Threat and Exposure Management. Because the Vulnerability Assessment service scans endpoints for vulnerabilities, TippingPoint users must also either install Endpoint Sensor or a third-party vulnerability scanning tool so that vulnerabilities will display in Threat and Exposure Management.",
