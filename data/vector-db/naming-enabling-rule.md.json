You can also add notes about the policy rule. Procedure On the Basic Information tab on the left side: Select Enable to put the policy rule into effect, or clear this option to disable it. Name the policy rule. Note Trend Micro recommends using a descriptive name that will allow administrators to easily identify this policy rule from the rule list. For instance, if you are creating a spam policy rule that applies to the one.example.com domain, you might name it something like One Example Spam Rule. Type any note information for this policy rule. Proceed to the next screen to specify recipients and senders. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base",
