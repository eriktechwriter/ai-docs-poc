A potential attack path contains: Entry point assets with risk detections indicating the asset is vulnerable to compromise Entry point assets are typically accessible from the internet or displaying signs of potential compromise. A potential path for lateral movement that could allow attackers to reach critical assets using asset relationships Relationships are determined by analyzing the following: Network activities User activities Administrative actions Permissions Cloud asset traffic High-value critical assets that serve as desirable target points for attackers Asset criticality is determined based on asset attributes, represented by platform tags assigned to the asset such as job role, device ownership, or device type.",

You may set a custom criticality level for an asset from the asset profile page if you feel the level assigned by Trend Vision One is insufficient. For information on specific asset profile screen types, see Asset profile screens. Note In certain cases, an asset may serve as the entry and target point for an attack path, so no lateral movement path is required.
