Disabling Container Security on Kubernetes and Amazon ECS clusters is a straightforward task. For Kubernetes clusters, you can also uninstall the Helm chart to remove Container Security. For Amazon ECS clusters, there are other methods available if you want to remove protection at the account level. Note Disabling Container Security on a cluster does not delete existing data received by Trend Vision One. Procedure To disable Container Security on a Kubernetes cluster: Go to Cloud Security → Container Security → Inventory/Overview. Select the Kubernetes node in the tree. Select the radio button next to the necessary cluster. Click Remove Cluster. To disable Container Security on an Amazon ECS cluster: Go to Cloud Security → Container Security → Inventory/Overview.",
