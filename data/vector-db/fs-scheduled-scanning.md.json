You can schedule multiple folders at once or one at a time. Selecting multiple folders is useful if they share the same scanning schedule, while selecting single folders is useful if you want a different schedule for the folder. Note Scheduled scanning requires Service Gateway 3.0.19 or higher. Procedure On the Inventory page, select the folder paths that you want to have the same schedule and select Manage scanning configuration. Tip To add a schedule to a single folder, click its Settings icon at the right side of the row. Select Scheduled scan on the Modified Scanning window. Select the schedule from the list, and add the time. Click Save. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base",
