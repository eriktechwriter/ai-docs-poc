Restore the connection promptly when all issues have been resolved. Procedure Go to Directories → Users/Endpoints. Select to view endpoints. Click the name of an endpoint in the list. On the Endpoint information screen that appears, click Task → Isolate. Trend Micro Apex Central disables the Isolate option on endpoints for the following reasons: The agent on the endpoint runs an unsupported version. The user account used to log on to Trend Micro Apex Central does not have the necessary permissions. A message appears at the top of the Endpoint information screen that allows you to monitor the isolation status. After isolation completes, the message closes and a notification appears on the target endpoint to inform the user.",
