You can investigate a Data Lineage graph to: determine the origin point of sensitive data view how sensitive data has been transmitted from one endpoint to another view detailed information about a specific file, including file type, file size, and the file's URI. If the file is a zip file, you can expand to see the compressed files. The following table describes the elements that comprise Data Lineage. Element Description Left panel Observed Attack Techniques Lists the individual events detected in your environment and related MITRE information. Endpoints Lists the affected endpoints and highlighted objects of the alert. Graph Chain view Visualizes how sensitive data has transmitted from one endpoint to another.",
