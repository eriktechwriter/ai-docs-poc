You can specify them to be global, by-region or a combination of both by entering a JSON script. If you have already set up your CloudFormation template and want to use by-region quarantine buckets, you need to re-deploy or update the CloudFormation template using Cloud Account Management. Use the one of the following JSON scripts in the FileSecurityStorageQuarantineBucket or the FileStorageSecurityCleanBucket field when creating or updating your CloudFormation templates: To enable the bucket to be global, you include only the global key:{\"global\":\"s3-global-bucket-name\"}All files are moved to the global bucket.",
