If you are experiencing installation errors, review the following tips to resolve most issues.\n\n- Make sure you are running the installer with Administration or root privileges. Not having sufficient access rights causes installation to fail.\n\n- Ensure your operating system has the required utilities to perform the installation.\n\n  - Windows requires the following PowerShell utilities:\n\n    - `Invoke-WebRequest`: required for downloading tools and agent components\n\n    - `Expand-Archive`: required for extracting files\n\n  - Linux rquires the following utilities:\n\n    - `curl`: required for downloading. Must have a version installed that supports TLS v1.2.\n\n    - `tar`: required for extracting files",
