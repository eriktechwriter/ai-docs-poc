The credits you receive retain the equivalent value, utility, and expiration date of the original license, but provide you added flexibility. No change will be made to the license agreement or renewal process. Important No action is required on your part. Trend Micro will automatically calculate the equivalent credit value of your existing subscription and add it to your credit balance. The following table describes how the credit equivalent is calculated.",
