Compliance Score is calculated using a simple unweighted formula: (Total number of successful Checks / Total number of Checks) * 100 Low compliance scores suggest a pressing need to take remediation actions to resolve failures. Does disabling rules / suppressing checks impact the Compliance Score? Disabled rules or Suppressed checks are not included in the calculation. Therefore, when you disable rules or suppress failed checks, you might see tiny improvements in the Compliance Score. The best way to improve your score is to improve your infrastructure so that it passes more tests. Our formula supports and encourages this behaviour.",
