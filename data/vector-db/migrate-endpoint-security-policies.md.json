Endpoint Security Policies is designed to replace the General Sensor Settings in Endpoint Inventory with a policy-based method for configuring your Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent. Upon provisioning Endpoint Security Policies, whether you opt-in to the pre-release preview or when the feature officially releases, the General Sensor Settings menu is removed from Endpoint Inventory. This replacement affects your settings and configurations, including Trend Vision One user role permissions. Before starting to use Endpoint Security Policies, review the following features and configurations to ensure a smooth transition from using General Sensor Settings. Review user role permissions.",
