For more information, see Deploy agents. Computers added using this method do not support the endpoint sensor and do not have XDR functionality. Trend Micro recommends only using this method for testing purposes or troubleshooting with your support provider. Tip If you haven't already installed the agent, see Use deployment scripts to add and protect computers or Manually install the agent for instructions. Before the installed agent can protect its computer or be converted to a relay, you must activate the agent with Server & Workload Protection. Activation registers the agent with Server & Workload Protection during an initial communication.",
