Connection-based filtering at the MTA connection level, including IP reputation-based filtering provided by Trend Micro Email Reputation Services (ERS), is the first tier. The second is content-based filtering at the message level. Tip IP reputation-based filters use only IP address data to filter messages. You can also use sender email address and domain to filter incoming messages. Approved senders bypass IP reputation-based filtering at the MTA connection level. See IP reputation order of evaluation. Cloud Email Gateway Protection makes use of Trend Micro Email Reputation Services (ERS) Standard Service and Advanced Service. Email Reputation Services use a standard IP reputation database and an advanced, dynamic IP reputation database (a database updated in real time).",
