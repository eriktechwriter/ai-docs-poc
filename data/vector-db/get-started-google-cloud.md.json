Use the tag to identify snapshots waiting to be scanned and to exclude the snapshots from any automated deletion processes you have configured. Snapshots are automatically deleted from your Google Cloud project after the scan completes. You can deploy Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection in your Google Cloud project using one of two methods: Traditional: Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection is deployed directly into your project. The function runs using your project's cloud resources, which increases the costs associated with your cloud project. Using the traditional deployment method, you might not be able to differentiate between your direct cloud resource usage and Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection resource usage.",
