However, unless you have upgraded the kernel, the agent often does not need to update its kernel support package. Therefore for agent 20.0.0-3067+, you can disable optional kernel support package updates to improve performance. Disable kernel support package updates on one computer Procedure In the Server & Workload Protection console, go to Computers.
