Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection can use the Suspicious Object lists synchronized from the Suspicious Object Management app during scanning. Note The Suspicious Object List feature is disabled by default. It applies to all ATP policies. Procedure In Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, go to Policies → Global Settings → Other Settings → Suspicious Object Settings. On the Suspicious Object List screen that appears, enable or disable the use of the lists during scanning as necessary. Click Save. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection utilizes the suspicious file list in Malware Scanning and the suspicious URL list in Web Reputation.",
