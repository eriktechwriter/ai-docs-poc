A security policy is a collection of security settings used to monitor the security status of each managed device. You can assign multiple security policies to the same device. The policy with the highest priority will be evaluated to assign a risk level to the device. The following table outlines the actions available on the Mobile Policy screen (Mobile Security → Mobile Security Policies). Action Description Switch between policies for Android and iOS/iPadOS Click Android or iOS/iPadOS to manage policies for Android and iOS/iPadOS.

All settings of the selected policy (excluding targets) are reused in the new policy. Change the policy priority Hover over a policy. When the icon () appears on the left of the policy entry, drag and drop the policy to your preferred location.
