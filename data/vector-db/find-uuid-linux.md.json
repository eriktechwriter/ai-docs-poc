Universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) are used to help identify partitions related to malware detection by Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection. You may use the UUID to search for more information, such as the location of the malware, about the detection in XDR Data Explorer. To find the UUID for a Linux-based partition: Procedure Use the blkid command. Type sudo blkid to return a list of all available disk partitions on your Linux system and the associated attributes, including UUIDs when available. Note The sudo blkid command also returns information on loop devices. Type sudo blkid | grep UUID= to return information only on disk partitions on your Linux system that have available UUIDs. Use the lsblk command.",
