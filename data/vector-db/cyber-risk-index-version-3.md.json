Version 3.0 of the Cyber Risk Index algorithm expands your organization's ability to clearly visualize cyber risk and efficiently prioritize mitigation and remediation efforts using refined risk score calculations, more precise risk identification, and a broader risk scope. The updated Cyber Risk Index algorithm incorporates the following enhancements: Weight, criticality, and impact calculation changes Security configuration risk events associated with machine learning or behavior monitoring feature enablement contribute more to the Cyber Risk Index. Trend Micro threat researchers have determined that misconfiguration of these features is one of the main contributors to successful infrastructure breaches.",

Trend Micro continues to recommend that you prioritize mitigation actions for the highest-impact CVEs detected on your assets. Internet-facing assets contribute more to your Cyber Risk Index and are assigned the \"Internet exposure: public-facing\" tag to indicate high criticality. New risk factor The new Predictive analytics risk factor, part of the Exposure category, includes current and future risk events involving potential attack paths and predicted targeted attacks, allowing you to take more proactive security measures. Refined Cyber Risk Index calculation The Cyber Risk Index is now rounded to the nearest tenth of a point to ensure all risk events are reflected in the index calculation, even when you have high amounts of assets.",

Brute-force-related risk events such as suspicious Windows logon attempts have been moved from the Activity and behaviors risk factor to the Account compromise risk factor to give the events greater weight in the index calculation. To decrease false positives, the brute force activity must reach a threshold indicative of an attack before triggering a risk event. Risk events affecting your entire organization rather than just individual assets, such as events involving misconfigured certificates or certificate templates, are now included in the index calculation to give you a more comprehensive picture of organizational risk.",
