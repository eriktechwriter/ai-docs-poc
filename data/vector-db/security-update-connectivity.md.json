Procedure To verify that both a route exists and that the relay port number is open, enter the command: telnet [relay IP] [port number] If the telnet fails, verify that a route exists and that firewall policies (if any) allow the traffic by pinging or using traceroute. Also verify that the port number is open, and doesn't have a port conflict. To verify that the DNS server can resolve the domain name of the relay, enter the command: nslookup [relay domain name] If the test fails, verify that the agent is using the correct DNS proxy or server (internal domain names can't be resolved by a public DNS server such as Google or your ISP).",
