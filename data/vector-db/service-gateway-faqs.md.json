    "content": "How many network interface cards (NICs) can a Service Gateway appliance support? Each Service Gateway appliance supports up to two NICs, enabling flexible network segmentation and traffic routing. How often are security patch updates released? When Trend Micro receives a CVE or ZDI vulnerability report, our security team performs a CVSS evaluation of the current Service Gateway build. If the vulnerability impacts Service Gateway, a critical patch is released or the vulnerability is resolved in the next build release depending on the severity. New builds are normally released every two weeks. Who can access the Service Gateway CLI? The Service Gateway virtual appliance only allows the default admin user to sign in to the Command Line Interface Shell (CLISH) console. The admin user is required to change the password when signing in for the first time. The password can be changed manually with the command configure password.",

    "content": "Service Gateway supports cloud deployments with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. How do you check CPU compatibility for Service Gateway 3.0? Service Gateway 3.0 migrates the base operating system from CentOS to ensure continued service and security. The new base operating system has minimum CPU architecture requirements, supporting only AMD and Intel 64-bit (x86-64-v2 and later). If your CPU does not meet the minimum requirements, you cannot upgrade to Service Gateway 3.0. To determine whether your CPU meets the minimum architecture requirements, check your system properties. Alternatively, you may run a script or program to check your CPU architecture. For Linux systems, run the following script from the command line shell: #!/bin/bash function check_cpu_support_x86_64_v2() { flags=$(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | head -n 1 | cut -d: -f2) supports_v2='awk \"/cx16/&&/lahf/&&/popcnt/&&/sse4_1/&&/sse4_2/&&/ssse3/ {found=1} END {exit !found}\"' echo \"$flags\" | eval $supports_v2 i",
