In addition to the metadata document, Trend Vision One requires instructions for interpreting the data in the assertion from the IdP in order to know how to authenticate users. This is done using mapping and claims.\n\n- Mappings are used to associate attributes in Trend Vision One with the user attributes in your IdP.\n\n  :::note\n  Attributes might appear under different names in different IdPs, though this does not affect mapping.\n  :::\n\n- Claims are pieces of information about the user provided by the IdP in an assertion.",
