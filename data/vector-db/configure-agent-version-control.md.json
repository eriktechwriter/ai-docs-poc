As new agents are released by Trend Micro, your security operations team can test them in controlled environments before changing the version control settings to expose the new agents to downstream applications teams in their production environment.

However, the version 12 feature release agents with version 12.5.0.350 are considered later than an LTS agent with version 12.0.0.460. In summary, choose Latest if you want the latest LTS or FR agent for the platform Latest LTS: (default) Indicates to use the latest long-term support (LTS) software build .
