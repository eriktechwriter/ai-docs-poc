Consider the following entry: First Name:_John_ Last Name:_Smith_ The Forms - First Name, Last Name list has a “distance” condition of fifty (50) and the commonly used form fields of “First Name” and “Last Name”. In the example above, Data Loss Prevention triggers a violation as the number of characters between the “F” in First Name and the “L” in Last Name is equal to eighteen (18). For an example of an entry that does not trigger a violation, consider the following: The first name of our new employee from Switzerland is John. His last name is Smith.",
