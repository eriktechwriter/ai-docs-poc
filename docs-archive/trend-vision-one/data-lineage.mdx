# Data Lineage

Data Lineage offers a visualization of how sensitive data has been transmitted between endpoints within your organization, and identifies potential data leakage points. You can investigate a Data Lineage graph to:

- determine the origin point of sensitive data

- view how sensitive data has been transmitted from one endpoint to another

- view detailed information about a specific file, including file type, file size, and the file's URI. If the file is a zip file, you can expand to see the compressed files.

:::note

To access Data Lineage, you must enable Data Security and then do the following:

- Create a data policy to specify the network locations you want to monitor for sensitive data. For more information, see [Data Policy](data-policy-overview.mdx)

- Configure an endpoint security policy with the **Endpoint sensor detection and response** and **Data Detection Response** settings enabled. For more information, see [Configure endpoint security policies](configuring-endpoint-policies.mdx).

  For more information about Data Security, see [Data Security](data-security-overview.mdx).
