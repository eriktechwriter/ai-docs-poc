# Rulesets

Define Container Protection rulesets to ensure protection for your containers during Runtime Security scanning.

Runtime security provides visibility into container activity that violates a customizable set of rules. Currently, runtime security includes a set of predefined rules that provide visibility into MITRE ATT&CK framework tactics for containers, as well as container drift detection. Container Security can automatically mitigate problems detected by the runtime security feature. If a pod violates any rule during runtime, the issue is mitigated by terminating or isolating the pod based on the ruleset assigned to its Container Security policy.

:::note

Rulesets are compatible with Kubernetes and support Amazon EKS, Microsoft Azure AKS, Google GKE, and OpenShift running [supported Linux kernels](linux-kernels-major-minor.mdx).
