# Configuring syslog settings

When receiving events, Cloud Email Gateway Protection stores the events in its database and forwards syslog messages to an external syslog server in a structured format, which allows third-party application integration.

The **Syslog Settings** screen is composed of the following tabs:

- **Syslog Forwarding**: Specifies the mapping between syslog servers and different types of logs.

- **Syslog Server Profiles**: Enables you to add, edit or delete syslog servers for syslog forwarding.

To ensure Cloud Email Gateway Protection can properly forward syslog messages, configure your firewall to accept connections from the following IP addresses or CIDR blocks:

- North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific:

  `18.208.22.64/26`

  `18.208.22.128/25`

  `18.188.9.192/26`

  `18.188.239.128/26`

- Europe and Africa:

  `18.185.115.0/25`

  `18.185.115.128/26`

  `34.253.238.128/26`

  `34.253.238.192/26`

- Australia and New Zealand:

  `13.238.202.0/25`

  `13.238.202.128/26`

  `18.176.203.192/26`

  `18.177.156.0/26`

  `18.177.156.64/26`

  `15.168.56.0/25`

  `15.168.49.64/26`

  `15.168.56.128/26`

  `13.213.174.128/25`

  `13.213.220.0/26`
