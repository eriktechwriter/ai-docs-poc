# Protect the agent

During agent activation, the agent can authenticate the identity of the Server & Workload Protection console by pinning the console's certificate to the agent. It does this by validating the connecting console's certificate path and ensuring it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). If the certificate path is validated, the console authentication passes and activates the agents. This prevents agents from activating with a malicious server pretending to be Server & Workload Protection.

To protect your agents, you must configure each agent so it can recognize its authorized manager before the agent tries to activate:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to [Sectigo Intermediate Certificates - RSA](https://support.sectigo.com/articles/Knowledge/Sectigo-Intermediate-Certificates).

2.  Click **Download** under **Root Certificates \> SHA-2 Root : USERTrust RSA Certification Authority**.

3.  On the agent computer, copy the downloaded certificate to the server and rename it to `ds_agent_dsm_public_ca.crt`

4.  Move the `ds_agent_dsm_public_ca.crt` file to one of these locations:

    1.  On Windows: `%ProgramData%\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent\dsa_core`

    2.  On Linux or Unix: `/var/opt/ds_agent/dsa_core`

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you are activating agent version 20.0.1412+, the following error message appears upon activation, which indicates you have not pinned Server & Workload Protection's certificate to the agent:

"\[Warning/2\] | SSLVerifyCallback() - verify error 20: unable to get local issuer certificate"

Pinning a trusted certificate is optional, so you can ignore this error if it does not apply to you. However, to use a trusted certificate, follow the provided steps before activating the agent.
