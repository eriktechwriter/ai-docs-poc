# Inspection exceptions

Manage domain exceptions to exclude HTTPS requests towards certain domains from being inspected by the Internet Access Gateway.

Trend Vision One allows you to maintain a list of trusted domains. HTTPS content from these domains does not follow inspection rules and is always accessible by users.

Within each trusted domain, you can also add specific subdomains that you do not want to skip HTTPS inspection by the matched rules.
