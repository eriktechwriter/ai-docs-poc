# Agent console notifications

Review, manage, and customize the notifications users see on your managed endpoints.

The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent console can alert endpoint users in your environment to different conditions or detections. You can customize, enable, or disable the alerts when [configuring an Endpoint Security Policy](configuring-endpoint-policies.mdx).
