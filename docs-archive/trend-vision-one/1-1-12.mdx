# 1.1.12 - Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.

etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by `etcd:etcd`.

:::note

By default, etcd data directory ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.

### Audit {#audit}

On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

```bash
ps -ef | grep etcd
```

Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above).

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/etcd
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

```bash
ps -ef | grep etcd
```

Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above).

```bash
chown etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd
