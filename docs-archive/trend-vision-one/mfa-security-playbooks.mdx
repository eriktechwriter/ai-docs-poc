# Multi-factor authentication now available for certain critical actions in Security Playbooks

April 8, 2024—In order to increase the security of critical action use, you can now enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for security playbooks operations. With MFA, users are required to provide multiple forms of verification before they can create, edit, or delete playbooks, approve pending actions, manually execute playbooks from either Security Playbooks or Workbench, or upload a new custom script from Security Playbooks. You can configure MFA settings in the User Accounts app.

For more information, see [Enable and configure multi-factor authentication](enable-confige-mfa.mdx).
