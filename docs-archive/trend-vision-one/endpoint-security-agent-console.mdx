# Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent console

Discover the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent console on your endpoints and manage the settings available to users on your managed endpoints.

:::warning[Important]

The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent console is currently only available for Windows endpoints with the unified agent release version 202504. Support for additional operating system platforms is coming soon.

The agent console is only available for endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent installed.

The agent console currently only provides status and health information for Endpoint Sensor features. If you have deployed Standard Endpoint Protection or Server & Workload Protection to your endpoint, your system tray might show two agent consoles. Integration of Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Security Protection features into a single console experience is coming soon.
:::

The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent console is a user interface for the agent program accessible by users on managed endpoints. The agent console provides information about the installed agent and enabled security features. You can manage agent console settings such as enabling alerts, customizing alert messages, and controlling end-user access to the agent console in [Endpoint Security Policies](sensor-settings-policies.mdx).

Endpoint users can hover the mouse over the system tray icon (![](/images/AgentConsoleSysTrayIcon=4c51e4c9-adf0-4be5-84e1-0b23390537aa.webp)) to get a quick glance at the agent status, and click on the icon to open the agent console.
