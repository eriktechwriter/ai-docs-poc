You can use the API to add computers to Server & Workload Protection as part of the process of protecting new assets.

:::tip

Before using the API, consider using the following types of scheduled tasks to automatically discover and add computers:

- Discover Computers
- Synchronize Cloud Account
- Synchronize Directory
- Synchronize VMware vCenter

For more information, see [Maintain Protection Using Scheduled Tasks](protection-scheduled-tasks.mdx) or [Schedule Server & Workload Protection to perform tasks](schedule-perform-tasks.mdx).
:::

Use the following general procedure to add a computer:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Create a `Computer` object and set the hostname. The hostname is the only required property. The value must be the hostname or IP address that resolves to the computer.

    ```bash
    computer = api.Computer()
    computer.host_name = hostname
    ```

2.  Configure any other properties as you desire. See the [Create a Computer](https://automation.trendmicro.com/cloudone/workload-security/) operation in the API Reference for the available properties.

3.  Create a `ComputersApi` object and use it to create the computer on Server & Workload Protection.

    ```bash
    computers_api = api.ComputersApi(api.ApiClient(configuration))
    new_computer = computers_api.create_computer(computer, api_version)
    ```

    To see the properties that you can configure, see the [Create a Computer](https://automation.trendmicro.com/cloudone/workload-security/) operation in the API Reference.

    :::tip

    You can also use the Server & Workload Protection console to create a task that automatically configures computers when they are added. See [Automatically perform tasks when a computer is added or changed](autotasks-computer-changed-event.mdx).

    :::tip

    You can use the legacy REST API to enable the relay on a computer that is running an activated agent. The Deep Security Git repository contains scripts that accomplish this task:

    - [Bash](https://github.com/deep-security/ops-tools/blob/master/deepsecurity/manager-apis/bash/config-dsRelay.sh)
    - [Powershell](https://github.com/deep-security/ops-tools/blob/master/deepsecurity/manager-apis/powershell/config-dsrelay.ps1)

    For background information, seeÂ [Distribute security and software updates with relays](deploy-more-relays.mdx).

```bash
# Create the computer object
computer = api.Computer()
computer.host_name = hostname

# Add the computer to Server & Workload Protection
computers_api = api.ComputersApi(api.ApiClient(configuration))
new_computer = computers_api.create_computer(computer, api_version)
return new_computer.id
```
