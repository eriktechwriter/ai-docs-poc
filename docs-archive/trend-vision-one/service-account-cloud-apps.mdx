# Service account

:::Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection protects the following services:

- Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams

- Google Workspace, including Google Drive and Gmail

- Cloud storage applications, including Box and Dropbox

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection requires service accounts to integrate with those applications and services that it protects. The service accounts can be categorized as:

- Delegate accounts to integrate with Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive

- Authorized accounts to integrate with Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams (Teams and Chat), Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Gmail

In Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, go to **Administration → Service Account**, click **Add**, hover over the organization for which you need to grant access to services, and select a service from the list that appears on the right side.

:::note

If you have granted Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to a service in the organization, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection grays it out on the list to prevent it from being selected again.
:::

After you have granted Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Microsoft 365 services for an organization, you can view the name of the Microsoft tenant associated with the organization.

:::note

If you have Trend Vision One, when you add a tenant in **Trend Vision One → Third Party Integration → Microsoft Entra ID**, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection automatically associates the tenant with an organization with no service to which Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection has been granted access. If there is no such organization, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection creates an organization and associates it with the tenant.
:::

If you chose to synchronize selected users when granting Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Exchange Online, you can continue to add new users or remove unavailable users. To do so, click **Update Synchronized Users** under **Status** of the Exchange Online service account, and then make necessary adjustments in the **Synchronized User List for Exchange Online** screen. For more information, see [Managing synchronized user list for Exchange Online](manage-synced-eo-user-list.mdx).

:::note

This option is not available if you chose to synchronize all users during the access granting.

## Re-creating an access token for Microsoft 365 services and Gmail {#re-creating-an-access-token-for-microsoft-365-services-and-gmail}

If the access token becomes invalid for any reason or you need to refresh the existing token, re-create an access token to continue using the service account.

The following procedure uses Exchange Online as an example to outline how to re-create an access token in the management console.

:::note

- For Gmail and Gmail (Inline Mode), provide an administrator account in the same domain as the one used during access grant to ensure successful re-creation of the access token.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Click **Recreate Access Token** under **Status** of the Exchange Online service account.

2.  On the **Recreate Access Token for Exchange Online Service Account** screen that appears, click **Grant Permission**, specify your Microsoft 365 Global Administrator credentials to sign in if prompted, and then click **Accept** on the screen that appears.

3.  Go back to the management console as instructed and verify that a checkmark icon appears for the step, indicating that the access token and the service account are valid.

4.  Click **Close**.

    :::note

    If you have updated Cloud App Security to Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, after re-creating an access token for Teams Chat, make sure you update the redirect URI to that of Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection in the app registration information in Microsoft Entra ID. For details, see [Creating an Microsoft Entra ID app for Teams protection](ms-entra-id-teams.mdx).

## Re-creating an access token for Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive {#re-creating-an-access-token-for-box-dropbox-and-google-drive}

If the access token becomes invalid for any reason or you need to refresh the existing token, re-create an access token to continue using the service account.

The following procedure uses Box as an example to outline how to re-create an access token in the management console.

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Click **Recreate Access Token** under **Status** of the Box service account.

2.  In the **Recreate Access Token for Box Service Account** dialog that appears, decide whether to use the current Box administrator or a different Box administrator.

    :::warning[Important]

    It is highly recommended to select the current administrator used for creating the Box service account. Changing administrators may result in the inability to access and recover files quarantined in the current administrator's quarantine folder, potentially leading to data loss.
    :::

3.  If you need to use a different administrator, before assigning a new administrator, make sure that all existing quarantined files are reviewed and processed. These files are stored in the current administrator’s quarantine folder and will not be manageable to Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection after the change.

4.  Go back to the management console and open the **Recreate Access Token for Box Service Account** screen.

5.  Click **Grant Permission**, specify your Box administrator credentials to sign in if prompted, and then click **Accept** in the screen that appears.

6.  Go back to the management console as instructed and verify that a checkmark icon appears for the step, indicating that the access token and the service account are valid.

7.  Click **Close**.
