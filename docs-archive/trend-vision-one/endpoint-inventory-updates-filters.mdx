# Endpoint Inventory updates Available Actions and adds new filters

March 4, 2024—The Available Actions quick filters have been updated with two new behaviors:

- If there are a total of zero (0) endpoints for an available action, Endpoint Inventory now hides the action, providing a cleaner interface.

- The "Sensor disabled" Available Action now only includes endpoints which have the **Trend Vision One** sensor installed but disabled by settings or policy.

Additionally, a new category of filters has been added for Sensor Maintenance Recommended. You can follow the recommended actions to resolve any issue the endpoints might have.
