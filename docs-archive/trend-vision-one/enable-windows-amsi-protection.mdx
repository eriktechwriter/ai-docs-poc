# Enable Windows AMSI protection (real-time scans only)

The [Windows Antimalware Scan Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal) (AMSI) is an interface provided by Microsoft in Windows 10 and later. Server & Workload Protection leverages AMSI to help detect malicious scripts. By default, this option is enabled in Server & Workload Protection malware scan configurations.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Open the properties of the malware scan configuration.

2.  On the **General** tab, select **Enable AMSI protection**.

3.  Configure the settings for **Detection level** and **Prevention level**.

    :::warning[Important]

    - Adjusting Detection and Prevention levels only supports agent version version 20.0.1.25770 and later. Unsupported versions use the default level of **2 - Moderate** and cannot be changed.

    - Higher levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends selecting **2 - Moderate** for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints.

    - The **Prevention level** must be the same or lower than **Detection level**.

    - The **Action to take** selection might affect the prevention actions taken for the selected prevention level.
    :::

4.  For **Action to take**, choose the remediation action that you want Server & Workload Protection to take when it detects malware:

    - **Terminate (recommended)**: Stops execution or running of the detected process.

    - **Pass**: Server & Workload Protection records an Anti-Malware Event without taking action on the process.

5.  Click **OK**.
