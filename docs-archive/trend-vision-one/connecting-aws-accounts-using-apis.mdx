# Connecting AWS Accounts Using APIs

Use the Trend Vision One APIs to connect AWS accounts, whether your company requires manual deployment of resources, or to customize aspects of the deployment process.

You can use the APIs located in the [Automation Center](https://automation.trendmicro.com/xdr/api-beta) to add, modify, and remove accounts from the Cloud Accounts app. The topics listed below provide steps on how to use the APIs in various tested use cases.
