# Allow trusted traffic to bypass the firewall

You can set up Server & Workload Protection to allow trusted traffic to bypass the firewall.

To configure this, the basic steps are as follows:

1.  Create a new IP list of trusted traffic sources
2.  Create incoming and outbound firewall rules for trusted traffic using the IP list
3.  Assign the firewall rules to a policy used by computers that trusted traffic flows through

After the firewall rules have been assigned to a policy, Server & Workload Protection will allow traffic from trusted sources in the IP list and will not scan the traffic for stateful issues or vulnerabilities.

### Create a new IP list of trusted traffic sources {#create-a-new-ip-list-of-trusted-traffic-sources}

1.  Click *Policies*.
2.  In the left pane, click **Lists → IP Lists**.
3.  Click **New → New IP List**.
4.  Enter a name for the IP list.
5.  Paste the IP addresses for your trusted sources into the *IP(s)* box, one per line.
6.  Click *OK*.

### Create incoming and outbound firewall rules for trusted traffic using the IP list {#create-incoming-and-outbound-firewall-rules-for-trusted-traffic-using-the-ip-list}

1.  Click *Policies*.
2.  In the left pane, click *Rules*.
3.  Click **Firewall Rules → New → New Firewall Rule**.
4.  Create a firewall rule for incoming trusted traffic using the values in the below:
    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Name:</p></td>
    <td><p><em>source name</em> Traffic - Incoming</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Action:</p></td>
    <td><p>Bypass</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Protocol:</p></td>
    <td><p>Any</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Packet Source:</p></td>
    <td><p>IP List (select the IP list created above)</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
5.  Create a firewall rule for outgoing trusted traffic using the values in the below:
    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Name:</p></td>
    <td><p><em>source name</em> Traffic - Outgoing</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Action:</p></td>
    <td><p>Bypass</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Protocol:</p></td>
    <td><p>Any</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><p>Packet Destination:</p></td>
    <td><p>IP List (select the IP list created above)</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

### Assign the firewall rules to a policy used by computers that trusted traffic flows through {#assign-the-firewall-rules-to-a-policy-used-by-computers-that-trusted-traffic-flows-through}

1.  Click *Policies*.
2.  In the left pane, click *Policies*.
3.  Double-click a policy to open its properties window.
4.  In the left pane of the policy's properties window, click *Firewall*.
5.  Click *Assign/Unassign*.
6.  Ensure your view at the top left shows *All* firewall rules.
7.  Use the search window to find the rules you created and select them.
8.  Click *OK*.
9.  Repeat the steps above for each computer that trusted traffic flows through.
