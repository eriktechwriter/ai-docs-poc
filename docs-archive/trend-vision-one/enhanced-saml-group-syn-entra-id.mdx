# Enhanced SAML group synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID

July 3, 2025—You can now add SAML groups using either group object IDs or email addresses for Microsoft Entra ID groups. This allows groups without email addresses to have SSO functionality.

Trend Vision One also supports real-time and regular sync of group data from Microsoft Entra ID to keep your SAML groups up to date, with an option to manually trigger data sync when needed.

The enhancements require access to the tenants where the groups reside. For groups added before June 30, 2025, ensure that the required access is granted to maintain SSO access and stay current.

For details, see [Add a SAML Group Account for Microsoft Entra ID](adding-saml-group-account.mdx).
