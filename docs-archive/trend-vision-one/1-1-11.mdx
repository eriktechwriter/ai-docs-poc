# 1.1.11 - Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the etcd data directory has permissions of 700 or more restrictive.

etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should not be readable or writable by any group members or the world.

:::note

By default, etcd data directory has permissions of 755.
