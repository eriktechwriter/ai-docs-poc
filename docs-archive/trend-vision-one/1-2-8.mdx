# 1.2.8 - Ensure that the –authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Turn on Role Based Access Control.

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode.

:::note

By default, RBAC authorization is not enabled.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

When RBAC is enabled you will need to ensure that appropriate RBAC settings (including Roles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings) are configured to allow appropriate access.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include RBAC.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes RBAC, for example:

```bash
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
```
