# Installing the directory synchronization tool

The Directory Synchronization Tool automates the import of directory files for valid recipient email addresses, user groups and email aliases. The Directory Synchronization Tool provides functionality similar to the **Import User Directory** feature on the **Directory Import** screen.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration â†’ Service Integration**.

2.  On the **API Access** tab, click **Add** to generate a key.

    The API Key is the global unique identifier for your Directory Synchronization Tool to authenticate its access to Cloud Email Gateway Protection. It must be used together with the administrator account that created it. A new API Key is enabled by default.

    If you want to change your API Key later on, click **Add** to generate a new key and use the new key in your requests. You can click the toggle button under **Status** to disable the old key or delete it if both of the following conditions are met:

    - Requests can be sent successfully with the new key.

    - The old key is not used by any other applications that have access to Cloud Email Gateway Protection.

    A maximum of two API Keys are allowed at a time.

    :::warning[Important]

    The API Key allows your Directory Synchronization Tool to communicate with Cloud Email Gateway Protection. Keep the API Key private.
