# Creating a File Attribute List

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Data Identifiers**.

2.  Click the **File Attribute** tab.

3.  Click **Add**.

    A new screen displays.

4.  Type a name for the file attribute list. The name must not exceed 100 bytes in length and cannot contain the following characters:

    - \> \< \* ^ | & ? \\ /

5.  Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.

6.  Select your preferred true file types.

7.  If a file type you want to include is not listed, select **File extensions** and then type the file type’s extension. Data Loss Prevention checks files with the specified extension but does not check their true file types. Guidelines when specifying file extensions:

    - Each extension must start with an asterisk (\*), followed by a period (.), and then the extension. The asterisk is a wildcard, which represents a file’s actual name. For example, `*.pol` matches `12345.pol` and `test.pol`.

    - You can include wildcards in extensions. Use a question mark (?) to represent a single character and an asterisk (\*) to represent two or more characters. See the following examples:

      \- `*.*m` matches the following files: `ABC.dem`, `ABC.prm`, `ABC.sdcm`

      \- `*.m*r` matches the following files: `ABC.mgdr`, `ABC.mtp2r`, `ABC.mdmr`

      \- `*.fm?` matches the following files: `ABC.fme`, `ABC.fml`, `ABC.fmp`

    - Be careful when adding an asterisk at the end of an extension as this might match parts of a file name and an unrelated extension. For example: `*.do*` matches `abc.doctor_john.jpg` and `abc.donor12.pdf`.

    - Use semicolons (;) to separate file extensions. There is no need to add a space after a semicolon.

8.  Type the minimum and maximum file sizes in bytes. Both file sizes must be whole numbers larger than zero.

9.  Click **Save**.
