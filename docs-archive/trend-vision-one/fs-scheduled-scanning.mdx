# Scheduled scanning

If you are using File Security Virtual Appliance, you can schedule your scanning at specified intervals. You can schedule multiple folders at once or one at a time. Selecting multiple folders is useful if they share the same scanning schedule, while selecting single folders is useful if you want a different schedule for the folder.

:::note

Scheduled scanning requires Service Gateway 3.0.19 or higher.
