# Simulations

Use attack simulations to find out what Trend Vision One can uncover for you.

Running simulations is a proactive way to assess and improve your security posture. By simulating different types of attacks in a controlled manner, you can practice using Workbench and Observed Attack Techniques to analyze cyber threats.

Trend Vision One supports four main categories of simulations:

- **Endpoint attack simulations**: Simulate attacks on endpoint devices.

- **Network attack simulations**: Simulate attacks targeting your network.

- **Email attack simulations**: Simulate phishing attempts and other email-based threats.

- **Cloud attack simulations**: Simulate threats to cloud workloads and other email-based threats.

- **Cross-layer attack simulations**: Simulate attacks targeting multiple security layers across your environment.

Depending on which simulation types you want to run, you may need to deploy additional sensors or configure specific policies in the related products. Use the following table to identify the configuration requirements for each simulation type:
