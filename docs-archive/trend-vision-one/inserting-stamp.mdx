# Inserting a stamp

The **Insert stamp in body** action inserts some standard confidentiality statement or a similar block of text into the message body. The stamps are maintained as named objects in the database and are selected from a list. The stamp definitions contain the stamp name, stamp content, whether they are to be inserted at the beginning or the end of the message body, and whether or not to avoid stamping TNEF and digitally signed messages to prevent breakage.

Cloud Email Gateway Protection recognizes messages signed using the S/MIME standard.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Insert stamp in body**.

2.  Select from the drop-down list of available stamps.

3.  To configure stamps in the list, click **Edit**.
