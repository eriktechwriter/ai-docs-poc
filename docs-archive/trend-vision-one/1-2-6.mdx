# 1.2.6 - Ensure that the –authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Do not always authorize all requests.

The API Server, can be configured to allow all requests. This mode should not be used on any production cluster.

:::note

By default, `AlwaysAllow` is not enabled.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

Only authorized requests will be served.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is not set to `AlwaysAllow`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to values other than `AlwaysAllow`. Example below:

```bash
--authorization-mode=RBAC
```
