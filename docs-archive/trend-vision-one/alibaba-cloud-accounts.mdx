# Alibaba Cloud accounts

Manage connections with your Alibaba Cloud accounts to allow Trend Vision One visibility into your cloud environment.

:::note

Alibaba Cloud is the proper name for the collection of cloud services provided by Alibaba Group colloquially known as AliCloud or Aliyun. The documentation for Trend Vision One Cloud Accounts only uses the term Alibaba Cloud for this service.
:::

The Alibaba Cloud screen allows you to view connected Alibaba Cloud accounts and manage connections within the Cloud Accounts app. You can access the Alibaba Cloud screen on the Trend Vision One console by navigating to **Cloud Security â†’ Cloud Accounts** and clicking on the **Alibaba Cloud** tab.

The following table details the actions you can take from the Alibaba Cloud screen.
