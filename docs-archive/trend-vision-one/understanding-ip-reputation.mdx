# Understanding IP reputation

Cloud Email Gateway Protection offers two tiers of protection. Connection-based filtering at the MTA connection level, including IP reputation-based filtering provided by Trend Micro Email Reputation Services (ERS), is the first tier. The second is content-based filtering at the message level.

IP reputation-based filters use only IP address data to filter messages. You can also use sender email address and domain to filter incoming messages. Approved senders bypass IP reputation-based filtering at the MTA connection level.

See [IP reputation order of evaluation](ip-reputation-order-evaluation.mdx).
:::

Cloud Email Gateway Protection makes use of Trend Micro Email Reputation Services (ERS) Standard Service and Advanced Service. Email Reputation Services use a standard IP reputation database and an advanced, dynamic IP reputation database (a database updated in real time). These databases have distinct entries, allowing Trend Micro to maintain a very efficient and effective system that can quickly respond to new sources of spam.

Configure the following settings on the **Settings** tab of the **IP Reputation** screen:

- **Quick IP List**, which is also known as dynamic IP reputation settings, controls how Cloud Email Gateway Protection uses the dynamic IP reputation database from Email Reputation Services Advanced Service.

- **Standard IP Reputation Settings** control how Cloud Email Gateway Protection uses the standard IP reputation database from Email Reputation Services Standard Service.

The other tabs of the **IP Reputation** screen are as follows:

- **Approved IP Address**

- **Blocked IP Address**

- **Approved Country/Region**

- **Blocked Country/Region**
