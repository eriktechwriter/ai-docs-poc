# VPN and Accessibility Service compatibility

The Zero Trust Secure Access (ZTSA) mobile solution leverages standard network-control mechanisms available on mobile platforms:

- iOS: Uses the local VPN
- Android: Uses the local VPN and Accessibility Service (mainly for personal profile scenarios)

### Compatibility with banking apps {#compatibility-with-banking-apps}

Some banking applications may restrict access when they detect the presence of a VPN or Accessibility Service. This is due to the security policies of the banking apps, and is not caused by any malfunction or limitation of the ZTSA solution.

:::warning[Important]

These restrictions are external to ZTSA and reflect the security enforcement mechanisms of third-party apps. Users should be aware that enabling ZTSA Internet Access may affect how certain banking apps work. For any issues, please contact the Trend Micro support team.
