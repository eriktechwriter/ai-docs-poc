# Entitlements

View a summary of entitlements and permissions assigned throughout your cloud infrastructure to help identify and manage risky cloud identities that could lead to compliance violations and security incidents.

:::warning[Important]

- This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- Entitlements currently only supports AWS accounts.

Cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) is a complex task that involves managing user and machine identities and privileges across a great volume of cloud resources. Without proper visibility and management, privileged user or machine identities with excessive permissions can lead to data breaches and other security risks. CIEM identifies risky cloud identities to help users enforce the principle of least privilege throughout the corporate cloud infrastructure.

In the **Entitlements** tab of Cloud Security Posture, table view shows you all cloud identities in your organization, along with the identity risk score, number of policies assigned, and resources the identity can access. Click the corresponding number of policies or accessible resources to view a complete list. Click the corresponding icon in the **Risk graph** column to see the asset profile, risk graph, and risk assessment for the identity.

In widget view, you can view a summary of your cloud identities along with the top identity-related issues detected in your cloud infrastructure. The following table outlines the widgets available in the widget view of **Entitlements**.
