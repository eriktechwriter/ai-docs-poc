# Cyber Risk Index algorithm version 3.0 to be released May 5

April 17, 2025—Version 3.0 of the Cyber Risk Index algorithm will be released on May 5, 2025. The updated algorithm expands your organization's ability to clearly visualize cyber risk and efficiently prioritize mitigation and remediation efforts using refined risk score calculations, more precise risk identification, and a broader risk scope. Enhancements include a new risk factor and new risk events, weight and impact adjustments, incorporation of new data sources, and refinements that give you more visibility into significant sources of risk.

Updates to the Cyber Risk Index algorithm may cause your Cyber Risk Index to rise or drop. Any fluctuations that coincide with the algorithm update are likely due to the update rather than an ongoing attack or system issue.

To prevent unnecessary index fluctuations and ensure consistent standards, Trend Micro avoids updating the Cyber Risk Index algorithm unless absolutely necessary to accommodate product enhancements and the changing cyber threat landscape. The last Cyber Risk Index algorithm update, version 2.0, occurred January 24, 2024.
