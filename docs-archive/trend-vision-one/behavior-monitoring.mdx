# Behavior Monitoring

Behavior Monitoring constantly monitors endpoints for unusual modifications to the operating system or on installed software. Behavior Monitoring protects endpoints through *Malware Behavior Blocking* and *Event Monitoring*. Complementing these two features are a user-configured *exception list* and the *Certified Safe Software Service*.

:::warning[Important]

By default, Behavior Monitoring is disabled on all versions of Windows Server platforms.
