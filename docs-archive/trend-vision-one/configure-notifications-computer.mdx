# Configure notifications on the computer

On Windows-based agents, you might occasionally see onscreen notification messages alerting you of Server & Workload Protection actions you must take that are related to the anti-malware and web reputation modules. For example, you might see the message, `A reboot is required for Anti-Malware cleanup task`. You must click OK on the dialog box to dismiss it.

If you don't want these notifications to appear:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to the Computer or Policy editor.

2.  Click **Settings** on the left.

3.  Set **Suppress all pop-up notifications on host** to **Yes**. The messages still appear as alerts or events in Server & Workload Protection. For more information about the notifier, see [Notifier](notifier-application.mdx).
