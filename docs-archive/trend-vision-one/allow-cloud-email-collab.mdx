# Allow Security Awareness in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection

Ensure users protected by Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection can receive phishing simulation emails from Security Awareness.

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection in Trend Vision One protects the users in your organization's cloud email and collaboration services, such as Gmail, Microsoft 365, and OneDrive. Security policies may block phishing simulation emails sent to protected cloud email accounts. You must configure Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to allow phishing simulation emails.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Security Awareness → Phishing Simulations** and click the settings icon (![](/images/gear_icon=fc9a51ad-35af-4fe3-92c6-5e41b2dfc5d9.webp)).

2.  Go to the **Allow List Settings** tab and copy the provided key and value.

3.  Go to **Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection → Policies** and select **Approved/Blocked Lists**.

4.  Choose the tab corresponding to your cloud email provider and enable **Approved Header Field List**.

5.  Paste the previously copied key into the **Name** field and the value into the **Value** field.

6.  Click **Add**.

7.  In **Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection → Policies**, select an active email protection policy or create a new one.

8.  Go to the **Virtual Analyzer** policy section and click the **Approved Lists** tab.

9.  Enable the **Approved Sender List**.

10. Type `*@mailrelaysrv.com` in the provided field and click **Add**.

11. Click **Save**.

    Phishing simulation emails now bypass quarantine and allow for the clicking and opening of simulation links.
