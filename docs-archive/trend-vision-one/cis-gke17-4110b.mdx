# 4.1.10 - Avoid non-default bindings to system:authenticated (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1

Avoid non-default `ClusterRoleBindings` and `RoleBindings` with the group `system:authenticated`, except the `ClusterRoleBindings system:basic-user`, `system:discovery`, and `system:public-info-viewer`.

Google's approach to authentication is to make authenticating to Google Cloud and GKE as simple and secure as possible without adding complex configuration steps. The group `system:authenticated` includes all users with a Google account, which includes all Gmail accounts. Consider your authorization controls with this extended group scope when granting permissions. Thus, group `system:authenticated` is not recommended for non-default use.

GKE assigns the group `system:authenticated` to API server requests made by any user who is signed in with a Google Account, including all Gmail accounts. In practice, this isn't meaningfully different from `system:unauthenticated` because anyone can create a Google Account.

Binding a role to the group `system:authenticated` gives any user with a Google Account, including all Gmail accounts, the permissions granted by that role and is strongly discouraged.

Default value:

`ClusterRoleBindings` with group `system:unauthenticated`:

```bash
system:public-info-viewer
```

No `RoleBindings` with the group `system:unauthenticated`.

### Impact {#impact}

Authenticated users in group `system:authenticated` should be treated similarly to users in `system:unauthenticated`, having privileges and permissions associated with roles associated with the configured bindings.

Care should be taken before removing any non-default `clusterrolebindings` or `rolebindings` from the environment to ensure they were not required for operation of the cluster. Leverage a more specific and authenticated user for cluster operations.

### Audit {#audit}

Use the following command to confirm there are no non-default `ClusterRoleBindings` to `system:authenticated`:

```bash
$ kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o json | jq -r '["Name"], ["-----"],
(.items[] | select((.subjects | length) > 0) | select(any(.subjects[]; .name
== "system:unauthenticated")) | [.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name]) |
@tsv'
```

Only the following default `ClusterRoleBindings` should be displayed:

```bash
Name
-----
               system:public-info-viewer
               system:discovery
               system:public-info-viewer
```

If any non-default bindings exist, review their permissions with the following command and reassess their privilege.

```bash
$ kubectl get clusterrolebinding [CLUSTER_ROLE_BINDING_NAME] -o json \
    | jq ' .roleRef.name +" " + .roleRef.kind' \
    | sed -e 's/"//g' \
    | xargs -l bash -c 'kubectl get $1 $0 -o yaml'
```

Confirm that there are no `RoleBindings` including the `system:authenticated` group:

```bash
$ kubectl get rolebindings -A -o json \
    | jq -r '["Namespace", "Name"], ["---------", "-----"], (.items[] |
select((.subjects | length) > 0) | select(any(.subjects[]; .name ==
"system:unauthenticated")) | [.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name]) | @tsv'
```

There should be no `RoleBindings` listed.

If any bindings exist, review their permissions with the following command and reassess their privilege.

```bash
$ kubectl get rolebinding [ROLE_BINDING_NAME] --namespace
[ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE] -o json \
    | jq ' .roleRef.name +" " + .roleRef.kind' \
    | sed -e 's/"//g' \
    | xargs -l bash -c 'kubectl get $1 $0 -o yaml --namespace
[ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE]'
```

### Remediation {#remediation}

Identify all non-default `clusterrolebindings` and `rolebindings` to the group `system:authenticated`. Check if they are used and review the permissions associated with the binding using the commands in the Audit section above or refer to [GKE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/best-practices/rbac).

Strongly consider replacing non-default, unsafe bindings with an authenticated, user-defined group. Where possible, bind to non-default, user-defined groups with least-privilege roles.

If there are any non-default, unsafe bindings to the group `system:authenticated`, proceed to delete them after consideration for cluster operations with only necessary, safer bindings.

```bash
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding
[CLUSTER_ROLE_BINDING_NAME]
kubectl delete rolebinding
[ROLE_BINDING_NAME]
--namespace
[ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE]
```
