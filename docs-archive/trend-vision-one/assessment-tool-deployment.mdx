# Assessment tool deployment

Deploy the assessment tool before you start the endpoint assessment, Samba vulnerability assessment, or Log4Shell vulnerability assessment.

If deployed correctly, the tool automatically collects and uploads data to Trend Vision One for in-depth analysis and reporting.
