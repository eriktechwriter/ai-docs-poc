# Integrity Monitoring events

For general best practices related to events, see [Events in Server & Workload Protection](event-logging.mdx).

To see the Integrity Monitoring events captured by Server & Workload Protection, go to Events & Reports \> Events \> Integrity Monitoring Events.

### What information is displayed for Integrity Monitoring events? {#what-information-is-displayed-for-integrity-monitoring-events}

These columns can be displayed on the Integrity Monitoring Events page. You can click Columns to select which columns are displayed in the table.

- *Time:* Time the event took place on the computer.
- *Computer:* The computer on which this event was logged. (If the computer has been removed, this entry will read "Unknown Computer".)
- *Reason:* The Integrity Monitoring rule associated with this event.
- *Tag(s):* Event tags that are applied to this event.
- *Change:* The change detected by the integrity rule. Can be: Created, Updated, Deleted, or Renamed.
- *Rank:* The ranking system provides a way to quantify the importance of events. By assigning "asset values" to computers, and assigning "severity values" to rules, the importance ("rank") of an event is calculated by multiplying the two values together. This allows you to sort events by rank.
- *Severity:* The Integrity Monitoring rule's severity value
- *Type:* Type of entity from which the event originated
- *Key:* Path and file name or registry key from which the event originated
- *User:* User ID of the file owner
- *Process:* Process from which the event originated
- *Event Origin:* The Server & Workload Protection component from which the event originated

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>8000</p></td>
<td><p>Info</p></td>
<td><p>Full Baseline Created</p></td>
<td><p>Created when the agent has been requested to build a baseline or went from 0 Integrity Monitoring rules to n (causing the baseline to be built). This event includes information on the time taken to scan (ms), and number of entities cataloged.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>8001</p></td>
<td><p>Info</p></td>
<td><p>Partial Baseline Created</p></td>
<td><p>Created when the agent had a security configuration where one or more Integrity Monitoring rules changed. This event includes information on the time taken to scan (ms), and number of entities catalogued.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>8002</p></td>
<td><p>Info</p></td>
<td><p>Scan for Change Completed</p></td>
<td><p>Created when the agent is requested to do a full or partial on-demand scan. This event includes information on the time taken to scan (ms), and number of CHANGES catalogued. (Ongoing scans for changes based on the FileSystem Driver or the notify do not generate an 8002 event.)</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>8003</p></td>
<td><p>Error</p></td>
<td><p>Unknown Environment Variable in Integrity Monitoring Rule</p></td>
<td><p>Created when a rule uses a ${env.EnvironmentVar} and "EnvironmentVar" is not a known environment variable. This event includes the ID of the Integrity Monitoring rule containing the problem, the name of the Integrity Monitoring rule, and the name of the unknown environment variable.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>8004</p></td>
<td><p>Error</p></td>
<td><p>Bad Base in Integrity Monitoring Rule</p></td>
<td><p>Created when a rule contains an invalid base directory or key. For example, specifying a FileSet with a base of "c:\foo\d:\bar" would generate this event, or the invalid value could be the result of environment variable substitution the yields a bad value. This event includes the ID of the Integrity Monitoring rule containing the problem, the name of the Integrity Monitoring rule, and the bad base value.</p></td>

<td><p>8005</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>8006</p></td>
<td><p>Error</p></td>
<td><p>Unsupported Entity in Integrity Monitoring Rule</p></td>
<td><p>Created when a known but unsupported EntitySet is encountered in an Integrity Monitoring rule. This event includes the ID of the Integrity Monitoring rule containing the problem, the name of the Integrity Monitoring rule, and a comma-separated list of the unsupported EntitySet names encountered. Some EntitySet types such as RegistryKeySet are platform-specific.</p></td>
</tr>

Examples of valid feature values are "whereBaseInOtherSet", "status", and "executable".</p></td>

This event includes the ID of the Integrity Monitoring rule containing the problem, the name of the Integrity Monitoring rule, the type of entity set (for example, FileSet), and a comma-separated list of the unsupported feature names encountered. Some feature values such as "status" (used for Windows service states) are platform-specific.</p></td>

This event includes the ID of the Integrity Monitoring rule containing the problem, the name of the Integrity Monitoring rule, the type of entity set (for example,FileSet), and a comma-separated list of the unknown EntitySet attribute names encountered. You would get this event if you wrote &lt;FileSet dir="c:\foo"&gt; instead of &lt;FileSet base="c:\foo"&gt;</p></td>
