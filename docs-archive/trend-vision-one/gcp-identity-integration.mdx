# Configuring Google Cloud Identity integration

Grant Trend Micro permission to access your Google Cloud Identity data in one or multiple tenants for use in Trend Vision One apps.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Open the **Google Cloud Identity** screen from **Workflow and Automation â†’ Third-Party Integration** or from a Trend Vision One app that requires Google Cloud Identity permissions.

2.  Locate the permissions required by the desired associated app.

    - For more on associated apps requiring Google Cloud Identity data access, see [Google Cloud Identity data usage in associated apps](gcp-id-usage-associated-apps.mdx).

    - If you have more than one Google Cloud Identity tenant, add the tenant and ensure you grant the appropriate permissions.

3.  Grant access permissions for a Google Cloud Identity tenant.

    1.  Click **Grant permissions** in the **Status** column corresponding to the desired associated app.

    2.  Sign in to the Google administrator account that manages the Google Cloud Identity tenant.

    3.  In the Google Admin console, view and confirm the permissions required.

    4.  Click **Accept**.

        When permissions are successfully granted, the name of the tenant appears in the **Google Cloud Identity** screen.
