# Logpoint SIEM integration

Allow Logpoint to collect alert and event data from Workbench and Observed Attack Techniques for analysis.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, obtain the **Authentication token**.

    1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation â†’ Third-Party Integration**.

    2.  Select **Logpoint SIEM**.

    3.  Use the copy icon (![](/images/copyicon=GUID-BD854E6D-5EB9-4181-BE68-D5F743237995=1=en-us=Low.webp)) to obtain the **Authentication token**.

2.  Add *Trend Vision One Alerts* as a log source in the Logpoint console.

    1.  Add a new log source on the **Log Sources** screen.

        The **Add Log Source** window appears.

    2.  Select the *Trend Vision One Alerts* template.

    3.  On the **Connector** tab, specify the **Authorization Type** and paste the authentication token obtained from the Trend Vision One console.

        Logpoint provides default settings for the **Source**, **Endpoints**, **Routing**, and **Normalization** tabs. You can select an optional enrichment policy on the **Enrichment** tab.

    4.  Click **Save Changes**.

    Logpoint begins collecting alert and event data from Trend Vision One. Logpoint can only collect data generated after connecting Trend Vision One as a log source. You might need to allow some time before new data starts to appear in the Logpoint console.
