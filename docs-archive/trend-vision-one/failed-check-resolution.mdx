# Failed check resolution

Whilst providing continuous monitoring and assurance of your AWS infrastructure, Trend Vision One™ – Cloud Risk Management also acts as an education tool. It provides detailed resolution steps and the rationale behind each rule to help users follow best practices to avoid security vulnerabilities, performance and cost efficiencies, and reliability risks. The **Resolve** button directs users to the related rule and remediation steps on the [CConformity Knowledge Base](https://www.cloudconformity.com/conformity-rules/), which provides a step-by-step guide on how to resolve the failure.

:::note

Only those rules that are associated with failed checks will display a **Resolve** button.
