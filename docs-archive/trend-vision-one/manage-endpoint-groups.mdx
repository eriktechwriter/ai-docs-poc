# Manage endpoint groups

If you updated from Apex One as a Service or Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security, review your endpoint groups to ensure everything looks as expected. You can manage your Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection groups using the Endpoint Inventory screen.

:::note

Endpoints which have deployed Endpoint Sensor only and are not managed by a Protection Manager cannot be added to groups. You can use the **Add filters** (![](/images/endpointSecurityFilterIcon=20230614105454.webp)) button and search field to locate endpoints by parameters such as agent policy, device type, operating system, and more.
