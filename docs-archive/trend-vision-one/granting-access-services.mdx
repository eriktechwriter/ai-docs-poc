# Granting Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to services

Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection requires that access to your services be granted before protecting your service. With access granted, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection obtains necessary permissions to access the target service to scan for threats and take actions.

You can grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to the following services:

- Microsoft 365 services: Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams (Teams), and Microsoft Teams (Chat)

- Cloud storage services: Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive

- Gmail

In addition, after you grant access to Microsoft 365 services, you can create two types of service accounts for dedicated purposes:

- [Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) account:](using-mip-account.mdx) Allows Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to scan Microsoft 365 service content encrypted by one of Microsoft's information protection solutions.

- [Microsoft Identity Protection account:](using-ms-id-protection-account.mdx) Allows Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to obtain data from Microsoft Identity Protection for use in its dashboard widgets.
