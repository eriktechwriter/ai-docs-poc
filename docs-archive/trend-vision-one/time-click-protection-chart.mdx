# Time-of-click protection chart

The **Time-of-Click Protection** chart on the **Other Statistics** tab of **Dashboard** displays the total number of URL clicks, number of clicks allowed and blocked, number of clicks warned and stopped, and number of clicks warned but clicked through.

Select a time period by **Date**, **Week** or **Month** to show daily, weekly or monthly data for the selected time period.

The specified time period only affects the data shown on this chart and its corresponding thumbnail chart on the **Threats** tab. Changing these selections does not affect other charts.

:::note

If you select **Outgoing** from **Direction**, this chart will be hidden because Time-of-Click Protection applies only to incoming messages.

The following is the specific data displayed:
