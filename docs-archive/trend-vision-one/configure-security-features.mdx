# Edit a policy and security modules

View, manage, and configure security module settings for your Endpoint Security Policies.

:::warning[Important]

- Policies, Threat Prevention, Access Control, Data Security Sensor, Sandbox Submission, Exclusions, and Brower Extention are "Pre-release" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- These features are not available in all regions.

- Configure your [policy resources](endpoint-security-policy-resources.mdx) before creating a policy.

- Navigating between the security modules or leaving the **Policy Settings** screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click **Save** before leaving the current screen.
:::

Security modules consist of a collection of features and settings organized around endpoint agent capabilities. After you create a policy, you can view and edit the security module settings from the **Policy Settings** window. Security modules control a range of settings including monitoring levels, exclusions, rules, and user permissions. Some modules use policy resources to manage their settings. For more information, see [Policy Resources](endpoint-security-policy-resources.mdx).

Endpoint Security Policies supports configuring the following security modules:
