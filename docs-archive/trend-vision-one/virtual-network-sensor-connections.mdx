# Configuring Virtual Network Sensor connections

Manage how the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One.

:::warning[Important]

Network Inventory only supports managing connection settings for Virtual Network Sensor version 1.0.1393 or later.

Connecting using a Service Gateway as a proxy requires a Service Gateway with the Forward Proxy Service configured and enabled. For more information, see [Manage services in Service Gateway](managing-services-service-gateway.mdx).
:::

You can manage and change the method your Virtual Network Sensors use to connect to Trend Vision One in the Network Inventory app.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Network Security → Network Inventory → Virtual Network Sensor**.

2.  Select one or more Virtual Network Sensors to configure.

3.  Click **Configure Connection Settings**.

    The **Sensor Connection Settings** screen appears.

4.  Select the **Connection method**.

    - **Direct connection**: the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One directly. Make sure the Virtual Network Sensor is able to connect to the internet when using this configuration.

    - **Connect using a custom proxy**: the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One through a third-party proxy. After choosing this method, configure the following fields:

      - **Proxy address**: Specify the IP address of the proxy.

      - **Proxy port**: Specify the connecting port of the proxy.

      - **Proxy server requires authentication**: (Optional) Select if the proxy requires authentication credentials.

      - **User name**: Specify the user name for the proxy credentials.

      - **Password**: Specify the password for the proxy credentials.

    - **Connect using a Service Gateway as proxy**: the Virtual Network Sensor connects to Trend Vision One through a Service Gateway. Select a Service Gateway to use for this method.

      :::warning[Important]

      The Virtual Network Sensor must be able to connect to a Service Gateway with the Forward Proxy Service configured and enabled. For more information, see [Manage services in Service Gateway](managing-services-service-gateway.mdx).
      :::

5.  Click **Test Connection**.

    :::warning[Important]

    Test Connection only tests if the Virtual Network Sensor can connect using the current settings. The test does not validate the new connection settings.
