# 1.1.2 - Ensure that the API server pod specification file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the API server pod specification file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The API server pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the API server. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, the `kube-apiserver.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
