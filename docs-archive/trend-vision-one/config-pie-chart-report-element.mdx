# Configuring the Pie Chart Report Element

This task assumes that you have already added the **Pie Chart** report element to a custom report template row.

For more information, see [Adding or Editing Custom Templates](adding-or-editing-custom-templates.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the **Pie Chart** report element, click **Edit**.

    The **Edit Pie Chart \> Step 1: Data View** screen appears.

2.  Select the type of report data you want to display from the **Data Views** directory.

3.  Click **Next \>**.

    The **Step 2: Set Query Criteria** screen appears.

4.  To filter the data that displays, select **Custom criteria**.

5.  Specify the **Match** rule for the custom filter.

    - **All of the criteria**: Data must match all the specified criteria.

    - **Any of the criteria**: Data can match any of the specified criteria.

6.  Specify the filtering criteria, each of which consists of three parts:

    - Data type: Corresponds to a column returned by the data view

    - Operator: Used to match or exclude data type values

    - Value: Select criteria from the drop-down controls or specify values in the text boxes

    :::note

    The options that display depend on the selected data view, and the selected data type and operator.

    Trend Micro Apex Central supports a maximum of 20 filters.
    :::

7.  Add or remove criteria using the plus (![](/images/icon_add_criteria=GUID-4689DC18-D66C-4A83-8B5C-FD8A3F3BAE8C=1=en-us=Low.webp)) and minus (![](/images/icon_remove_criteria=GUID-A282B7A3-F83E-4395-B290-817619C7A5ED=1=en-us=Low.webp)) controls.

8.  Click **Next \>**.

    The **Step 3: Specify Design** screen appears.

9.  Specify the **Name** used as the title for the chart.

10. From the **Drag Available Fields** list, drag-and-drop the data that displays in the following locations:

    - **Data Field**: Specifies the total count for data appearing in the chart

    - **Category Field**: Specifies how the data is separated in the chart

11. In the **Data Properties** section, configure the following:

    - **Aggregated by**: The method in which to display data

      - **Total number of instances**: Includes duplicate results in the data

      - **Number of unique instances**: Displays only one instance of duplicated result types

      For example, if an endpoint detects 5 instances of "VirusA" and 3 instances of "VirusB" in the data, the detection count on the graph would display the following values:

      - Total number of instances = 8 (virus detections, regardless of virus name)

      - Number of unique instances = 2 (unique virus types, regardless of number of occurrences)

12. In the **Category Properties** section, configure the following:

    - Specify the **Label** name that appears on the horizontal axis of the chart.

    - Select the **Sorting** order and direction.

      - **Aggregation value**: Sorts based on the count value of the data

      - **Category name**: Sorts alphabetically based on the category name

    - Select the **Filter summarized result** check box to filter the data that displays in the report.

      - Specify the maximum number of items to display.

      - Enable **Aggregate remaining items** to group all remaining data in the "Others" category.

13. Click **Save**.

    The **Add/Edit Report Template** screen appears with the updated chart settings applied.
