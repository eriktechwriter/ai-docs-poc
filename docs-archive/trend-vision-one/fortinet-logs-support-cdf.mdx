This update includes the following changes:

To help you test the new feature, we added custom detection filters to the [tm-v1-detection-models GitHub repository](https://github.com/trendmicro/tm-v1-detection-models/tree/main/tm-v1-sigma-rules/third_party_logs/fortinet/Fortigate/Firewall). You can import these detection models to your Trend Vision One environment to test the new integration.
