# Edit training campaign notification templates

Add images, including logos and informative content, to your training campaign notification templates.

When you create a training campaign, participants receive an invitation message based on the invitation template available for all training campaigns. You can also choose to send reminders and completion notifications to participants, both based on the available templates. You can modify the notification templates to suit your organization's needs by adding placeholders, editing text, and adding images.
