# Avoid Microsoft Safe Links alerts when opening phishing simulation landing pages

Ensure recipients can open phishing simulation URLs without encountering a Microsoft Safe Links alert.

If your recipients are using Microsoft Defender 365, you may [configure an allow list](setup-365-defender-allow-list.mdx) to ensure delivery of Security Awareness Training content without triggering Microsoft Safe Links alerts. However, recipients using older versions of Windows may still encounter Microsoft Safe Links alerts when opening phishing simulation URLs. To avoid alerts, you may add a mail flow rule in Microsoft Exchange or manually configure Safe Links settings in Microsoft Defender 365.
