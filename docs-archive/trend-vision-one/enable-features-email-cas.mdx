# Enabling key features for email accounts with Cloud App Security

Optimize the protection over the email accounts in your email service by enabling key features in Cloud App Security.

For email accounts with key features disabled, you can enable the key features for the accounts from the Email Asset Inventory.

The following operation is available only when you click the number of accounts with certain key feature disabled in **Cyber Risk Overview → Security Configuration → Email Security → Email Sensor**.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Click **Manage Policy** to enable key Cloud App Security features for the selected accounts.

    The selected users may belong to different policies. In this case, click **Update Policy** next to each of the listed policies.
