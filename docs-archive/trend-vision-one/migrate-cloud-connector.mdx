# How do I migrate to the new cloud connector functionality?

If you previously used the "Add Cloud Account" wizard to import Amazon Web Services resources into Deep Security as a Service, those resources are organized by AWS region on *Computers*. You may have run the wizard more than once if you have multiple AWS regions.

Server & Workload Protection the ability to display your AWS instances under your AWS account name, organized in a hierarchy that includes the AWS Region, VPC, and subnet.

Before migrating your AWS resources, you will need to edit the policy that allows Server & Workload Protection to access your AWS account:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Log in to your Amazon Web Services Console and go to *Identity and Access Management (IAM)*.

2.  In the left navigation pane, click *Policies*.

4.  Go to the *Policy Document* tab and click *Edit*.

5.  Edit the policy document to include this JSON code:

    ```bash
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "cloudconnector",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ec2:DescribeImages",
                    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                    "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                    "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
                    "ec2:DescribeTags",

            }
        ]
    }
    ```
