    3.  Specify whether your users can add senders to bypass Advanced Spam Protection.

        The senders trusted by your users do not bypass other enabled scan filters, such as Malware Scanning, File Blocking, Web Reputation, and Virtual Analyzer.

        :::note

        Senders trusted by your users can not be blocked by the blocked sender list for Advanced Spam Protection in policy settings. However, such users can be blocked by the Blocked Lists for Exchange Online in global settings.

3.  Specify email reporting settings for your users to report emails to Trend Micro or administrators in your organization.
