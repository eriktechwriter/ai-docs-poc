# Importing a Keyword List

Use this option if you have a properly-formatted `.xml` file containing the keyword lists. You can generate the file by exporting the keyword lists from the Trend Vision One administrator console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration → Policy Objects → DLP Data Identifiers**.

2.  Click the **Keyword** tab.

3.  Click **Import** and then locate the `.xml` file containing the keyword lists.

4.  Click **Open**.

    A message appears, informing you if the import was successful.

    :::note

    Every customized keyword list is identified by its *name* field in the `.xml` file. This name is a unique internal name that does not display on the administrator console.

    If the file contains a customized keyword list that already exists, the existing keyword list is overwritten. If the file contains any predefined keyword list, the predefined keyword list is skipped during the import of the remaining customized keyword lists.
