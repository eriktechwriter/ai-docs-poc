# Template Scanner API now supports Terraform HCLtemplates for CREM users

March 31, 2025—Cloud Risk Exposure Management (CREM) users will now be able to scan Terraform HCL (`.tf`) templates with the latest API directly by scanning a `.zip` file of HCL templates. as opposed to converting the Terraform HCL (`.tf`) templates into HCL plan (`.json`) files before scanning. Additionally, you can now use the `cloudPosture/scanTemplateArchive` endpoint to POST a ZIP file containing your Terraform templates to be scanned. For more information, see [the Template Scanner API documentation](https://automation.trendmicro.com/xdr/api-beta/).
