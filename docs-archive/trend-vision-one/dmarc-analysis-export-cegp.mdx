# DMARC report analysis result export enhancements

August 19, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection now allows administrators to export DMARC report compliance check details into CSV files directly from the console, either by selecting specific records or exporting all filtered results.

Exporting selected records happens instantly, while exporting all results triggers an export task. This streamlined export process improves efficiency, supports faster data analysis, and enables easier day-to-day follow-up and reporting.
