# Cloud account tags

:Each account in the Cloud Risk Management dashboard can have a tag attached to it. Tags can be used for several purposes such as [creation of groups](grouped-accounts.mdx), search, etc. The default tag is the *Environment* parameter provided during account creation, which can be updated at any time.

:::note

Changing tags associated with an account could affect groups - Accounts with tags also matching the Group's tags are considered to be part of the group. Account tags can also be reached via [Cloud Account General settings](cloud-account-general-settings.mdx)
