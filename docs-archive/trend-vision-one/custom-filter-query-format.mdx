# Filter query format

Format your query string using the same query language as in **XDR Data Explorer**.

### Filter query limitations {#filter-query-limitations}

Although custom filter queries use the same query language as queries, custom filter queries have a few additional limitations:

- All queries must contain at least one field name and value pair. (`endpointHostName:endpoint-123`)

- Query strings must contain at least one defined value. You can use the asterisk wildcard (\*) in compound queries if at least one value is defined. (`endpointHostName:endpoint-123 AND fileName:*`)

- Any custom tags containing dots (.) cannot be searched.

- Range operators (\<, \>, \<=, \>=) are not supported in custom filter queries.

To learn more about query syntax and regex in custom filters, see [Query syntax](search-syntax.mdx) and [Use regex in custom filters](using-regex-custom-filters.mdx).

### Filter query format tips {#filter-query-format-tips}

To improve query performance and avoid lengthy execution time, consider the following:

- Put simple criteria in the front of the query string.

- Put fields that return a large volume of data (such as **objectRawDataStr** or **rawDataStr**) at the end of the query string.

- Avoid using too many wildcards, or put wildcards at the end of the query string.

- Use only one or two tactics, techniques, and procedures per filter.

- Use as few operators as possible in a filter.

- Put the **eventSubId** at the beginning of the filter conditions to quickly narrow down the dataset.

- Use **processName** instead of **processCmd** to streamline filtering and reduce complexity.

- Put a simple subset pattern before a complicated pattern (such as complex regex or middle wildcards).

  Example: For `objectRawDataStr:'*(abcd -UseBasicParsing)*' AND (objectRawDataStr: '* abcd *' OR objectRawDataStr: '* efgh *')`, extract the longest plain sub-string, which is `objectRawDataStr: '*-UseBasicParsing*'`. Then add another filter that checks `objectRawDataStr: '*-UseBasicParsing*'` first.

- Use full match with exact values instead of partial match. (`objectFileHashMd5: "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" ``objectFileHashMd5: "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"`)
