# Automated anomaly detection with pre-defined correlation rules in Correlated Intelligence in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection

August 18, 2024 – When administrators enable Correlated Intelligence while creating a new ATP policy, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection automatically applies all pre-defined correlation rules for anomaly detection. These rules are categorized into three levels of aggressiveness, allowing administrators to tailor the enforcement of these rules according to their organization's security needs and email service requirements.

For existing ATP policies, administrators need to manually configure whether to apply all or partial pre-defined rules.
