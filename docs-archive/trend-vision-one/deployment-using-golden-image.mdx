# Deployment using a golden image

:Review information about deploying endpoint agents using system templates such as a golden image.

:::warning[Important]

- Read these instructions carefully. Cloning your own VDI machines causes agent IDs to be duplicated and prevents deployed agents from performing response actions.

- The Image Setup Tool only supports Windows agents.

- Non-persistent endpoints configured to require a user login only report to Trend Vision One when a user is logged in. When not logged in, Endpoint Inventory shows the status as disconnected or not available (-).

- Non-persistent endpoints configured to not require a login continue reporting to Trend Vision One as long as the VM is powered on. Multiple sessions of the same VM are assigned different unique IDs to avoid duplicate ID issues.

- For Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection, you must install the full Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent package including the Endpoint Sensor to use the Image Setup Tool.
:::

Trend Vision One Endpoint Security supports deploying agents and sensors using VDI templates, golden images, or custom image templates (Microsoft Azure). Endpoint Security automatically detects the endpoint when a user signs in and adds the desktop to the Endpoint Inventory list. You can download the Image Setup Tool from Endpoint Inventory to help configure the golden image or template for the following supported scenarios:

- Physical desktops configured using a golden image

- Persistent virtual desktops

- Non-persistent virtual desktops

The Image Setup Tool is an accurate and efficient tool designed specifically to configure the agent settings for your golden image. Trend Micro recommends using the Image Setup Tool to avoid errors in deployment regardless of the deployment type. Non-persistent virtual desktops must use the Image Setup Tool to configure the virtual desktop image template.

Feature support for persistent and non-persistent virtual desktops is different from physical endpoints. Refer to the following table for more information.

Endpoint Security offers separate settings for physical/persistent desktops and non-persistent desktops. Virtual desktops which are not turned on regularly are automatically removed based on the agent settings. The time interval is set separately for persistent and non-persistent desktops. For information regarding inactive agent removal, see [Endpoint Settings](sensor-settings.mdx).

Trend Micro has tested virtual desktop deployments in the following environments, and only offers support for the listed platforms.

Trend Vision One supports multi-session VDI solutions. Trend Vision One does not change or limit the functionality of your virtual desktop operating systems. The Endpoint Security VDI solution works by creating unique device IDs for each virtual desktop after provisioning.
