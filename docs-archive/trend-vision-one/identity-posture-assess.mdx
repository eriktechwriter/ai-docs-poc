# Identity Posture Assessment

Scan your organization's identity-related assets to detect potential exposures and identify high-risk events using Identity Posture Assessment.

You can always find your previous assessment reports by clicking **Assessment History** on the **Cyber Risk Assessment** screen.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Assessment â†’ Cyber Risk Assessment**.

2.  In the **Identity Posture Assessment** area, click **Start Assessment**.

3.  Connect to your configured Identity and access management (IAM) system and run the Identity Posture Assessment.

    :::note

    Currently only Microsoft Entra ID is supported.
    :::

    - If you do not have any Microsoft Entra ID tenants added, click **Third-Party Integration \> Microsoft Entra ID** and follow the prompts to add Microsoft Entra ID tenants and grant permissions to the tenants in [Third-Party Integration](third-party-integration.mdx).

      Click **Back** after you grant all necessary permissions to the tenants. You will be redirected back to **Identity Posture Assessment** with all the tenants appearing in the list. **Data upload** shows a green circle.

    - If you have already added tenants but have not granted permissions, click the tenant name to grant permissions in [Third-Party Integration](third-party-integration.mdx).

    - If you have already added tenants and granted permissions, select a tenant from the list and click **Start Assessment**.

      :::note

      You can assess only one tenant at a time.
      :::

4.  Wait until your tenant finishes the assessment.

    You will receive an email notification when the assessment is complete. Click the link in the notification to access the Trend Vision One console, and click **View Report** in the **Identity Posture Assessment** area.

5.  Check the results on the assessment report and take risk remediation actions immediately if necessary.

    The following table lists the actions available on the report (if applicable).
