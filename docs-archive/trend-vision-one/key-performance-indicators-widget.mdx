# Key Performance Indicators Widget

By default, the widget marks events as "Important" (![](/images/icon_important=GUID-9A35C87D-9810-426A-BE7C-C4BF3038E434=2=en-us=Low.webp)) at 15 occurrences and "Critical" (![](/images/icon_critical=GUID-711D600F-D73E-418C-AF8A-A59771BA4EF6=1=en-us=Low.webp)) at 30 occurrences. Optionally, mark events as Important or Critical by customizing event thresholds.
