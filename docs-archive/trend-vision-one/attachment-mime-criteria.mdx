# Using attachment mime content type criteria

The **Attachment is** "**MIME content type**" criteria allows you to create policy rules that take actions on messages based on the MIME content-type of attachments a message contains.

:::note

Where the **Attachment is** "**MIME content type**" criteria makes decisions based on the MIME content-type indicated, the **Attachment is** "**true file type**" criteria scans the headers of the actual attached files themselves for the identifying signatures.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Scanning Criteria** tab, click **Advanced**.

2.  Select the **Attachment is** "**MIME content type**" criteria.

3.  Click the "**MIME content type**" link.

    The **Attachment MIME Content Type** screen appears.

4.  From the drop-down list, select **Selected MIME content types** or **Not selected MIME content types**.

5.  Select the MIME content types for Cloud Email Gateway Protection to match on.

6.  If you want to block attachments by explicit MIME content types, type the names of the MIME content types to block, under the **Other MIME content types** text field.
