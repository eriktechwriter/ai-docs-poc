# Deploy a Virtual Appliance from File Security

You can also deploy a Virtual Appliance from File Security. You need to have a service gateway, and your platform must be compatible. If you have not set up service gateway, you can set it up as part of the deployment process. Although you can add the Trend Micro File Security Virtual Appliance on a service gateway containing other services, Trend Micro recommends that you have a dedicated serviced gateway for File Security Virtual Appliance.

When you add the File Security Virtual Appliance to your Service Gateway, the Service Gateway appears on the File Security Inventory page. Virtual appliances can have multiple servers, and servers can have multiple mount points. From this page you can add, modify, remove, or turn off servers and mount points for a specific Virtual Appliance.

Virtual Appliance can be used with the following file systems:

- NFS3, NFS4
- SMB 3.0, SMB 3.1

  :::note

  SMB requires Service Gateway 3.0.19 or higher.
