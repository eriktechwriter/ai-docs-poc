# Azure subscriptions

Manage connections with your Azure subscriptions to allow Trend Vision One visibility into your cloud environment.

The Azure subscriptions screen allows you to view connected Azure subscriptions and manage connections within the Cloud Accounts app. You can access the Azure subscriptions screen on the Trend Vision One console by navigating to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → Azure** and clicking on the **Azure** tab.

You can take the following actions from the Azure subscriptions screen.
