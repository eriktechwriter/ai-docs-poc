# Jira integration

Trend Vision One™ – Cloud Risk Management integrates with Jira. This includes Jira on-premise as long as it is accessible via the Internet. If you use Jira in your business workflow, you can manually create tickets or configure triggers for automatic ticket creation for any relevant events in your account. The Jira ticket is automatically closed when you resolve a vulnerability.

!!! note "" Cloud Risk Management allows the creation of issues in Jira. Notification settings for issues created in Jira can be configured within Jira. Open *Notification schemes* and configure as many users and groups as you want for newly created issues. Refer below for the links:

```bash
  * [_Jira Cloud_](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/creating-a-notification-scheme-776636401.html)
  * [_Jira Server_](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/creating-a-notification-scheme-861253478.html)
```

!!! note "" *Ticket Transition Limitations*

```bash
For a smooth ticket transition, you must ensure that:

- The Jira workflow contains an `OPEN` status and a `CLOSED` status.
- The workflow allows for a transition to `CLOSED` from any status.
- No additional fields must be required during transition to the `CLOSED` status.
```

2.  *Issue permission* - To Create / Close / Resolve / Delete issues
3.  *Comment Permissions* - To add comments

\*\*I have custom project fields in Jira. Why is the Jira integration not working?\*\*If the integration is connecting to Jira but not to the project, it could be because of the custom Jira project fields that are not yet supported. In such cases, we recommend creating a new project without custom fields.
