# 4.1.7 - Ensure that the certificate authorities file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1

Ensure that the certificate authorities file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.

The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

:::note

By default, in OpenShift 4, the `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` file has permissions set to 644.

### Audit {#audit}

1.  Use the following command to check the `clientCAFile` for each node in the cluster:

    ```bash
    for node in $(oc get nodes -ojsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
    do
            oc get --raw /api/v1/nodes/$node/proxy/configz | jq
    '.kubeletconfig.authentication.x509.clientCAFile'
    done
    ```

    The output should look like the following:

    ```bash
    /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt
    ```

2.  Check the file permissions on each node:

    ```bash
    for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
    do
           oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %a
    /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt
    done
    ```

3.  Verify that the permissions are 644.
