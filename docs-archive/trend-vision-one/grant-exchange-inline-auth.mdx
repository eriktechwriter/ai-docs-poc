# Granting access to Exchange Online (inline mode) with an authorized account

The steps outlined below detail how to grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Exchange Online (Inline Mode) with an Authorized Account from **Dashboard** for Inline Protection over both inbound and outbound messages.

Before the access grant, verify related security configuration in Microsoft to ensure that Inline Protection for Exchange Online works properly for your organization and emails get delivered as expected. For details, see [Verifying related security settings in Microsoft](verifying-security-settings-ms.mdx).
