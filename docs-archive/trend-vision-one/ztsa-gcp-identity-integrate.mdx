# Google Cloud Identity integration and SSO for Zero Trust Secure Access

Integrate with Google Cloud Identity to authenticate user access attempts and take action on risky account activity.

:::warning[Important]

You cannot configure single sign-on (SSO) from multiple IAMs. Ensure that you configure the necessary permissions and SSO on the IAM you want to use for Private Access and Internet Access authentication.

**Threat and Exposure Management** and **Zero Trust Secure Access** both require data upload permission to ensure certain features function properly. Revoking data upload permission may prevent secure access policy enforcement and risk analysis.
:::

Integration requires access to the Google Admin console using a Google administrator account with super administrator privileges.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Identity and Access Management**.

2.  Click **Grant permissions** under **Google Cloud Identity**.

    A new browser tab opens to **Third Party Integration → Google Cloud Identity**.

3.  Grant the relevant permissions associated with **Zero Trust Secure Access** by confirming the permissions in the [Google Admin console](gcp-identity-integration.mdx).

4.  In the Google Admin console, [Configure Google Cloud Identity](config-google-cloud-saml.mdx).
