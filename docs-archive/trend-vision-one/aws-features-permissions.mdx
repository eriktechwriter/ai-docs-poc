# AWS features and permissions

Enable cloud security features and permissions to give Trend Vision One greater visibility and protection over your cloud assets.

Enabling the Cloud Account features and permissions on your AWS accounts allows Trend Vision One apps and security features to access your cloud account and gain greater visibility over assets and monitor for potential threats. Each feature and permission is described in the table below.

:::warning[Important]

- Some features support a limited number of AWS regions. For more information, see [AWS supported regions and limitations](aws-supported-regions-limitations.mdx).

- Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection is a pre-release feature and is not part of the existing features of an official commercial or general release. Please review the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

<td><p>Core Features and Cyber Risk Exposure Management</p></td>
<td><p>The core set of features and permissions required to connect your AWS account</p>
<p>Core features enable you to connect your AWS account to Trend Vision One to discover your cloud assets and rapidly identify risks such as compliance and security best practice violations on your cloud infrastructure.</p>


:::note

<p>Core features are required to connect your AWS account and cannot be disabled. If you need to disconnect your account, see <a href="trend-vision-one-aws-accounts">AWS accounts</a></p>


:::


<p>The core features enable the following Trend Vision One apps and features to monitor your cloud environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery → Cloud Assets</strong></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="trend-vision-one-cloud-assets">Cloud assets</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery → APIs</strong></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="trend-vision-one-apis">APIs</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Cloud Security Posture</strong></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="trend-vision-one-cloud-posture">Cloud Security Posture</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Endpoint Security → Server &amp; Workload Protection</strong></p>
<p>You can manage EC2 instances and Amazon WorkSpaces can in Server &amp; Workload Protection like any other computer. These instances are tree structures and are treated as computer groups.</p>
<p>AWS assets are visible in the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>EC2 instances appear in the <strong>Computers</strong> screen, listed under your AWS account by region, VPC, and subnet.</p></li>
<li><p>Amazon WorkSpaces appear in the <strong>Computers</strong> screen, listed under your AWS account by region as part of the <strong>WorkSpaces</strong> group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="trend-vision-one-computers">Computers</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


:::note

<p>Your AWS assets appear in the Endpoint Inventory list. Assets without the endpoint agent installed appear as unmanaged endpoints.</p>

<td><p>Agentless Vulnerability &amp; Threat Detection</p></td>
<td><p>The feature and permission set to enable Cyber Risk Exposure Management (CREM) capabilities for your account</p>
<p>This feature set allows Trend Vision One to deploy Agentless Vulnerability &amp; Threat Detection in your AWS account to discover vulnerabilities and malware in AWS EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances, ECR images, and Lambda functions with zero impact to your applications. To learn more, see <a href="trend-vision-one-agentless-vulnerability-threat">Agentless Vulnerability &amp; Threat Detection</a>.</p>


:::note

<p>You can specify which resource types to include in scans when you <a href="trend-vision-one-adding-aws-account">add your AWS account</a> in Cloud Accounts. Three AWS resource types are currently supported: EBS (Elastic Block Store), ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and Lambda. All resources are included in vulnerability scanning by default. Anti-malware scanning is disabled by default but may be enabled at any time.</p>
