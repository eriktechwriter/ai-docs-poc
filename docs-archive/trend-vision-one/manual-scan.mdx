# Manual Scan

Manual Scan is an on-demand scan and starts immediately after a user runs the scan on the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent console. The time it takes to complete scanning depends on the number of files to scan and the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent endpoint's hardware resources.

Configure and apply Manual Scan settings to one or several agents and domains, or to all agents that the server manages.
