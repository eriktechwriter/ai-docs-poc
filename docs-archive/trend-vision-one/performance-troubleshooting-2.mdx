<td><p>Cloud Risk Management has optimised the platform to avoid unnecessary API calls. Examples of performance optimisation:1. when Cloud Risk Management calls the AWS API for S3 bucket list, the bot does not do repetitive calls, instead, the bot checks for changes only.2. Cloud Risk Management supports partial inventory. i.e. using partial lists of resources from AWS so the system is capable of dealing with partial calls e.g. S3 bucket list - secondary IP calls - if the bot fails to call second API calls, the rule engine will still work.3. Support for exponential backoff API.</p></td>
