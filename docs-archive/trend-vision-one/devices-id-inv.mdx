# Device

View information about the devices in your organization, including compliance and sync status.

The **Device** tab allows you to view devices in your organization managed by your identity provider. Devices registered with your identity provider include desktops, laptops, printers, and mobile devices that use single-sign on (SSO) or have conditional access policies applied.

The following table details the columns on the **Device** tab.
