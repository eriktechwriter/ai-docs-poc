# Create rules for bypassing the junk folder in Microsoft 365

Create rules in Microsoft 365 to allow phishing simulation emails to bypass user junk folders.

To ensure Microsoft 365 users can receive phishing simulation emails, you can configure rules to allow emails to bypass the junk folder in user mailboxes.

These instructions were valid for Microsoft 365 Exchange as of January 25, 2025.

    3.  In **Allow List Settings**, copy the header key and value.

2.  Create a new transport rule for Microsoft 365.

        The **New transport rule** window appears.

    5.  Click **Enter text**, paste the header key previously copied from the Trend Vision One console, and click **Save**.

    6.  Click **Enter words**, paste the header value previously copied from the Trend Vision One console, then click **Add** and **Save**.

    10. Review the rule settings and click **Save**. The new rule may take some time to propagate.

3.  If you have already created a rule to bypass clutter and spam filtering for phishing simulation emails, change the priority of the newly created rule to just below the clutter and spam filtering bypass rule. For more information, see [Microsoft's documentation on setting the priority of a mail flow rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules).
