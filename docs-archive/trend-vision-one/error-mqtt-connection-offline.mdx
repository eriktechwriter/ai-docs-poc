# Error: MQTT Connection Offline

After enabling Activity Monitoring, if you encounter an "MQTT Connection offline" error, address it as follows:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Ensure the agents have outbound connectivity to Trend Vision One.

    If you have a firewall or proxy, add the following URL to [the allow list](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security-web-reputation) and the SSL or TLS inspection settings:

    `agent-comm.workload.<cloudoneregion>.cloudone.trendmicro.com`

    - For accounts created before August 4, 2021, use `us-1` for the region.

    - For accounts created on or after August 4, 2021, verify the region in **Account Settings**.

    See [Required Workload Security URLs](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security-communication-ports-urls-ip) for the latest address list.

2.  For Deep Security Agent version 20.0.2-4960 or earlier, verify the agent Activity Monitoring configuration on the machine:

    - For Windows, enter the following commands when running a command prompt as Administrator:

      ```bash
      cd "C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent"
      sendCommand.cmd --get GetConfiguration | findstr -i Sensor
      ```

    - For Linux, enter the following command in a terminal:

      ```bash
      sudo /opt/ds_agent/sendCommand --get GetConfiguration | grep -i "sensor"
      ```

    The result should be as follows:

    ```bash
    sensorActivityEnabled=true
    Feature SENSOR state= 1
    ```

3.  Ensure the Internet of Things (IoT) connection is online:

    - For Windows, enter the following commands when running a command prompt as Administrator:

      ```bash
      cd "C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent"
      sendCommand --get GetIoT
      ```

    - For Linux, enter the following command in a terminal:

      ```bash
      sudo /opt/ds_agent/sendCommand --get GetIoT
      ```

4.  Ensure you have the latest agent. See [Upgrade the agent from the Computers page](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-workload-security-agent-upgrade).

5.  If the host was created as a clone, ensure that:

    - Cloning best practices were followed. See [Cloned virtual machines using Deep Security Agent (DSA) cause conflict among multiple cloned computers](https://success.trendmicro.com/en-US/solution/KA-0015884).
    - The host experiencing issues is the only host communicating with Deep Security Manager regarding the host record experiencing the alert.

6.  If Deep Security Agent has been re-registered with a new configuration for MQTT, restart the dsa-connect process or restart the agent on the host.

7.  If the issue persists:

    - Trend Vision One customers are advised to refer to [Trend Vision One Help and Support](https://success.trendmicro.com/en-US/solution/KA-0015172).
    - Trend Cloud One customers are advised to submit a ticket via [Trend Micro Cloud One Support](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/support).
