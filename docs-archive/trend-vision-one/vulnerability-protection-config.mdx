# Configuring Vulnerability Protection Settings

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Enable Vulnerability Protection**.

2.  Configure intrusion prevention settings:

    1.  Click the **Intrusion Prevention Rules** tab.

    2.  Select one of the following scanning profiles:

        - **Recommended**: Ensures protection against known vulnerability issues, provides more relevant data, and reduces performance impact on endpoints

        - **Aggressive**: Applies additional Intrusion Prevention Rules for suspicious network activities to the **Recommended** scanning profile

          :::warning[Important]

          Aggressive scanning may generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro strongly advises using the **Recommended** profile.
          :::

    3.  (Optional) Select a view to filter the list of Intrusion Prevention Rules by status.

        <table>
        <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 25%" />
        <col style="width: 75%" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
        <tr>
        <th><p>View</p></th>
        <th><p>Description</p></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><p>All</p></td>
        <td><p>Displays all Intrusion Prevention Rules</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Default (Enabled)</p></td>
        <td><p>Displays only the Intrusion Prevention Rules that the selected scanning profile enables by default</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Default (Disabled)</p></td>
        <td><p>Displays only the Intrusion Prevention Rules that the selected scanning profile disables by default</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>User-defined (Enabled)</p></td>
        <td><p>Displays only the Intrusion Prevention Rules enabled by the user</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>User-defined (Disabled)</p></td>
        <td><p>Displays only the Intrusion Prevention Rules disabled by the user</p></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

    4.  Modify the status of a rule by selecting from the *Status* drop-down control.

        - **Default (Enabled)**: The selected scanning profile enables the corresponding rule by default. Select to apply the rule status defined by the scanning profile.

        - **Default (Disabled)**: The selected scanning profile disables the corresponding rule by default. Select to apply the rule status defined by the scanning profile.

        - **User-defined (Enabled)**: Select to enable the rule.

        - **User-defined (Disabled)**: Select to disable the rule.

3.  Configure network engine settings:

    1.  Click the **Network Engine Settings** tab.

    2.  Select the **Network Engine Detection Mode\***.

        :::note

        You can also use the selected Network Engine Detection Mode to configure the Advanced Logging Policy.
        :::

        - **Inline**: Live packet streams pass directly through the Vulnerability Protection network engine. All rules are applied to the network traffic before the packets proceed up the protocol stack.

        - **Tap (Detect-only)**: Live packet streams are replicated and diverted from the main stream.

    3.  Configure the following settings:

        <table>
        <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 33%" />
        <col style="width: 67%" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
        <tr>
        <th><p>Setting</p></th>
        <th><p>Description</p></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><p>ESTABLISHED Timeout</p></td>
        <td><p>How long to stay in the ESTABLISHED state before closing the connection</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>LAST_ACK Timeout</p></td>
        <td><p>How long to stay in the LAST-ACK state before closing the connection</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Cold Start Timeout</p></td>
        <td><p>The amount of time to allow non-SYN packets that could belong to a connection that was established before the stateful mechanism was started</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>UDP Timeout</p></td>
        <td><p>The maximum duration of a UDP connection</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Maximum TCP Connections</p></td>
        <td><p>The maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Maximum UDP Connections</p></td>
        <td><p>The maximum number of simultaneous UDP connections</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Ignore Status Code</p></td>
        <td><p>Select up to 3 types of events to ignore</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><p>Advanced Logging Policy</p></td>
        <td><p>Select from the following settings:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Bypass</strong>: No filtering of events. Overrides the <strong>Ignore Status Code</strong> settings (above) and other advanced settings, but does not override logging settings defined on the Apex One server</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Network Engine Detection Mode*</strong>: Uses <strong>Tap Mode</strong> if <strong>Tap (Detect-only)</strong> is selected for the Network Engine Detection Mode, or <strong>Normal</strong> if <strong>Inline</strong> is selected for the Network Engine Detection Mode</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Normal</strong>: All events are logged except dropped retransmits</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Backwards Compatibility Mode</strong>: For support use only</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Verbose Mode</strong>: Same as <strong>Normal</strong> but including dropped retransmits</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Stateful and Normalization Suppression</strong>: Ignores dropped retransmit, out of connection, invalid flags, invalid sequence, invalid ack, unsolicited udp, unsolicited ICMP, out of allowed policy</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Stateful, Normalization, and Frag Suppression</strong>: Ignores everything that <strong>Stateful and Normalization Suppression</strong> ignores as well as events related to fragmentation</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Stateful, Frag, and Verifier Suppression</strong>: Ignores everything <strong>Stateful, Normalization, and Frag Suppression</strong> ignores as well as verifier-related events</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Tap Mode</strong>: Ignores dropped retransmit, out of connection, invalid flags, invalid sequence, invalid ack, max ack retransmit, packet on closed connection</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a more comprehensive list of which events are ignored for <strong>Stateful and Normalization Suppression</strong>, <strong>Stateful, Normalization, and Frag Suppression</strong>, <strong>Stateful, Frag, and Verifier Suppression</strong>, and <strong>Tap Mode</strong>, see <a href="trend-vision-one-advanced-logging-policy-modes">Advanced Logging Policy Modes</a>.</p></td>
