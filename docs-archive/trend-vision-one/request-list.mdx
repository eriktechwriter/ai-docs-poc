# Request list

Track and manage all the response action requests submitted by the Managed Services operations team.

**Managed Services** sends response action requests for your manual approval if you disable auto approval. You can choose either of the following ways to deal with the response action requests:

- Approve or reject a request directly in the email notification without accessing the Trend Vision One console.

- Get an overview of all requests and manage one or more requests on the **Request List** screen.

  :::note

  **Managed Services** retains the response action requests for 60 days after submission.

The following table outlines the actions you can perform on the response action requests.
