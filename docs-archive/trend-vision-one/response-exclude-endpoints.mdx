# Exclude specified endpoints from response actions

Set exclusions to prevent specific response actions from affecting groups of selected endpoints.

For some critical devices, exclusions from certain response actions may be necessary to keep traffic flowing or important processes running. Response action exclusions for an endpoint or group of endpoints apply no matter where in the Trend Vision One console a response action is triggered.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation â†’ Response Management** and click the **Settings** tab.

2.  Enable **Exclude specified endpoints from response actions** and click **Edit settings**.
