# Firewall events

:For general best practices related to events, see [Events in Server & Workload Protection](event-logging.mdx).

To see the firewall events captured by Server & Workload Protection, go to **Events & Reports → Events → Firewall Events**.

Firewall event icons:

:::note

1.  To search by user name on the **Firewall Events** tab, you must use the advanced search option.

2.  Event folding occurs when multiple events of the same type occur in succession. This saves disk space and protects against DoS attacks that may attempt to overload the logging mechanism.

### What information is displayed for firewall events? {#what-information-is-displayed-for-firewall-events}

These columns can be displayed on the firewall events page. You can click Columns to select which columns are displayed in the table.

- *Time:* Time the event took place on the computer.
- *Computer:* The computer on which this event was logged. (If the computer has been removed, this entry will read "Unknown Computer".)
- *Reason:* Log entries on this page are generated either by firewall rules or by firewall stateful configuration settings. If an entry is generated by a firewall rule, the column entry will be prefaced by "Firewall Rule:" followed by the name of the firewall rule. Otherwise the column entry will display the firewall stateful configuration setting that generated the log entry.
- *Tag(s):* Event tags that are applied to this event.
- *Action:* The action taken by the firewall rule or firewall stateful configuration. Possible actions are: Allow, Deny, Force Allow, and Log Only.
- *Rank:* The ranking system provides a way to quantify the importance of intrusion prevention and firewall events. By assigning "asset values" to computers, and assigning "severity values" to intrusion prevention rules and firewall rules, the importance ("rank") of an event is calculated by multiplying the two values together. This allows you to sort events by rank when viewing intrusion prevention or firewall events.
- *Direction:* The direction of the affected packet (incoming or outgoing).
- *Interface:* The MAC address of the interface through which the packet was traveling.
- *Frame Type:* The frame type of the packet in question. Possible values are "IPV4", "IPV6", "ARP", "REVARP", and "Other: XXXX" where XXXX represents the four digit hex code of the frame type.
- *Protocol:* Possible values are "ICMP", "ICMPV6", "IGMP", "GGP", "TCP", "PUP", "UDP", "IDP", "ND", "RAW", "TCP+UDP", AND "Other: nnn" where nnn represents a three digit decimal value.
- *Flags:* Flags set in the packet.
- *Source IP:* The packet's source IP.
- *Source MAC:* The packet's source MAC address.
- *Source Port:* The packet's source port.
- *Destination IP:* The packet's destination IP address.
- *Destination MAC:* The packet's destination MAC address.
- *Destination Port:* The packet's destination port.
- *Packet Size:* The size of the packet in bytes.
- *Repeat Count:* The number of times the event was sequentially repeated.
- *Time (microseconds):* Microsecond resolution for the time the event took place on the computer.
- *Event Origin:* The Server & Workload Protection component from which the event originated.

The following columns are also available. They display information for events that are triggered from containers on computers that are protected by agent version 12 FR or newer:

- *Interface Type:* Container interface type.
- *Container Name:* Name of the container where the event occurred.
- *Container ID:* Container ID of the container where the event occurred.
- *Image Name:* Image name that was used to create the container where the event occurred.
- *RepoDigest:* A unique digest that identifies the container image.
- *Process Name:* Name of the process (from the container) that caused the event.

:::note

*Log-only* rules will only generate a log entry if the packet in question is not subsequently stopped either by a *deny* rule, or an *allow* rule that excludes it. If the packet is stopped by one of those two rules, those rules will generate a log entry and not the *log-only* rule. If no subsequent rules stop the packet, the log-only rule will generate an entry.
