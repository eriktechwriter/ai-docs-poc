# What is Zero Trust Secure Access?

Ensure that only authenticated users and devices can access your corporate applications and internet sites based on granular rule-based security policies.

Zero Trust Secure Access protects your organization from unauthorized access to internal and external applications, and allows you to take immediate or automated action against possible access violations or risky user behaviors. Zero Trust Secure Access provides multiple access control services to provide the optimal protection against unwanted access.
