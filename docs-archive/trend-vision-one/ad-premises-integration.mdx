# Active Directory (on-premises) integration

:Synchronize objects and security event information from on-premises Active Directory servers for risk assessments and remediation actions.

This integration supports the following Windows operating systems:

- Windows Server 2025

- Windows Server 2022

- Windows Server 2019

- Windows Server 2016

- Windows Server 2012

- Windows Server 2008 R2

:::note

The integration also supports AWS Managed Microsoft AD for Data Synchronization and User Access Control. The integration does not support security event forwarding for AWS Managed Microsoft AD.

:::note

When integrating Trend Vision One with Active Directory on Windows Server 2025, you may encounter a binding failure if using LDAP. This is because LDAP is not enabled by default in Windows Server 2025.

To ensure successful integration, we recommend enabling LDAPS and using it for integration with Trend Vision One. Please refer to the official Windows documentation for instructions on enabling LDAPS.

If you prefer to use LDAP, it is still supported. However, you must manually enable LDAP in Windows Server 2025 by following the appropriate guidance in the Windows documentation before proceeding with the integration.
