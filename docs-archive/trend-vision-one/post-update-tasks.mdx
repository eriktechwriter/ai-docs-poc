:::warning[Important]

<p>After connecting an endpoint solution that is registered under a different business name or Primary User Account (formerly Trend Micro Account), only the managed protection agents are automatically moved to the updated Trend Vision One console. Any XDR Endpoint Sensor deployments do not move automatically and you must request assistance from Trend Micro Support. Before filing a support case, consolidate all business account offerings to ensure that the Support engineer can properly associate all your Endpoint Sensors and avoid any disruption of service.</p>
