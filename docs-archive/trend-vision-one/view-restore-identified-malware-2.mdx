# View and restore identified malware

:An identified file is a file that has been found to be or to contain malware and has therefore been encrypted and moved to a special folder on the protected computer. Whether or not an infected file can be viewed and restored depends on the Anti-Malware configuration, and the operating system on which the file was found:

- On Windows agents, you can view and restore [cleaned, deleted, or quarantined](customize-malware-remedial-actions.mdx) files.
- On Linux agents, you can view and restore only quarantined files.

For information about events that are generated when malware is encountered, see [Anti-Malware events](anti-malware-events.mdx).

## See a list of identified files {#see-a-list-of-identified-files}

The Events and Reports page provides a list of identified files. From there you can see the details for any of those files.

Advanced searches include one or more search criteria for filtering identified files. Each criterion is a logical statement comprised of the following items:

- The characteristic of the identified file to filter on, such as the type of file (infected file or malware) or the computer that was affected.
- An operator:
  - *Contains:* The entry in the selected column contains the search string.
  - *Does Not Contain:* The entry in the selected column does not contain the search string.
  - *Equals:* The entry in the selected column exactly matches the search string.
  - *Does Not Equal:* The entry in the selected column does not exactly match the search string.
  - *In:* The entry in the selected column exactly matches one of the comma-separated search string entries.
  - *Not In:* The entry in the selected column does not exactly match any of the comma-separated search string entries.
- A value.

To add a criterion, click the "plus" button (+) to the right of the topmost criterion.To search, click the Search button (the circular arrow).

## Restore identified files {#restore-identified-files}

## Create a scan exclusion for the file {#create-a-scan-exclusion-for-the-file}

Before you can restore a file to its original location, you have to create a scan exclusion so that Server & Workload Protection doesn't immediately re-identify the file when it reappears on the computer.

:::note

The following instructions describe how to create an exclusion for the file on an individual computer but you can make the same configuration changes at the policy level.
:::

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Open the Computers page and go to **Anti-Malware → Identified Files** and double click the identified file to view its properties.

2.  Note the file's exact name and original location.

3.  Still in the Computers page, go to **Anti-Malware → General** and click the Edit button next to each Malware Scan that's in effect to open the Malware Scan Configuration properties window.
