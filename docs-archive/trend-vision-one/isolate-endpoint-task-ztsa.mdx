# Isolate Endpoint task

You can take remediation measures on user accounts that may pose a security risk to your network environment on the Trend Vision One console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Locate the device that you want to take action on using the **Zero Trust Secure Access** or **Threat and Exposure Management** apps.

    - **Zero Trust Secure Access**: Go to the **User Information** screen by clicking on a user anywhere within the **Zero Trust Secure Access** app.

    - **Threat and Exposure Management**: Go to the **User Profile** screen.

2.  Click the options icon (![](/images/options_icon=1b2aff71-0b33-4aa1-b8aa-6105438834e7.webp)) and **Isolate Endpoint**.

    The **Isolate Endpoint Task** screen appears.

3.  (Optional) Specify a description for the task.

4.  Click **Create**.

    Trend Vision One creates the task and displays the current action status on the **Secure Access History** screen.

    Trend Vision One also creates the task and displays the current action status in the **Response Management** app.

5.  Monitor the task status.

    1.  Click **View task status** in the success message that pops up in the lower right corner.

        The **Remediation Logs** tab on the **Secure Access History** screen appears.

        You can also go directly to **Secure Access History â†’ Remediation Logs**, and locate the task using the search field.

    2.  View the task status under **Action status**.

        - *In progress...* (![](/images/inProgress=763d5319-3680-4b10-abca-a75782d8eb48.webp)): Trend Vision One sent the command to the enforcement point and is waiting for a response

        - *Successful* (![](/images/successful=d385863c-ae1f-4a76-8500-6d60d7a2de8f.webp)): The enforcement point successfully received and executed the command

        - *Unsuccessful* (![](/images/unsuccessful=e4c3ece6-3776-45dc-b99a-67195d7d21e0.webp)): An error or time-out occurred when attempting to send the command to the enforcement point

        - *Queued* (![](/images/queued=74fd3fa8-3cad-4955-9410-e97bbded1732.webp)): The server queued the task due to a high volume of requests or because the Security Agent was offline

        :::note

        The task status indicates whether the enforcement point was able to successfully receive and execute the command. It may take a few minutes for the process to complete.
        :::

    After resolving the risk issues on the isolated endpoint, you can restore network connectivity using the options icon (![](/images/options_icon=1b2aff71-0b33-4aa1-b8aa-6105438834e7.webp)) in the **Zero Trust Secure Access** or **Threat and Exposure Management** app.
