# Importing Templates

Use this option if you have a properly-formatted `.xml` file containing the templates. You can generate the file by exporting the templates from the Trend Vision One administrator console.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration → Policy Objects → DLP Compliance Templates**.

2.  Click **Import** and then locate the `.xml` file containing the templates.

3.  Click **Open**.

    A message appears, informing you if the import was successful.

    :::note

    Every customized template is identified by its *name* field in the `.xml` file. This name is a unique internal name that does not display on the management console.

    If the file contains a customized template that already exists, the existing template is overwritten. If the file contains any predefined template, the predefined template is skipped during the import of the remaining customized templates.
