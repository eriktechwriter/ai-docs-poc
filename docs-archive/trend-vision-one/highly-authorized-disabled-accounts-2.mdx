# Highly authorized disabled accounts

Learn about highly authorized disabled accounts and how to mitigate the risk the accounts pose.

A disabled admin account can be re-enabled by an attacker, granting the attacker access to sensitive data and systems. Re-enabling a disabled account may be easier for an attacker than granting admin privileges to a newly created user. Therefore, disabled admin accounts should be monitored and secured to prevent unauthorized access. For more information, see Microsoft Entra ID's information on [privileged account risks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/security-operations-privileged-accounts), including disabled accounts.

To mitigate this risk, remove any disabled accounts from the following roles or groups:

Microsoft Entra ID roles:

- Global Admin

- Privileged Role Administrator

- Share Point Admin

- Exchange Admin

Active Directory groups:

- Enterprise Admin

- Domain Admin

- Built-in Admin

Google Workspace roles:

- Super Admin
