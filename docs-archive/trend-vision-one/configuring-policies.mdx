# Configuring policies

The virus policy, spam policy, Correlated Intelligence policy, content filtering policy and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy screens all show a list of the currently defined policy rules and their status. From each screen, you can add a new policy rule and query, reorder, edit, copy, or delete existing policy rules.

:::note

If a policy rule applies to multiple domains and your account only has permission to manage a part of these domains, the policy rule is only visible. You cannot reorder, edit, copy, or delete the policy rule.
:::

The policy screens under **Inbound Protection** and **Outbound Protection** are technically separate and can be managed independently.

To go to the **Inbound Protection** screen, choose **Email and Collaboration Security Operations → Cloud Email Gateway Protection → Inbound Protection**.

To go to the **Outbound Protection** screen, choose **Email and Collaboration Security Operations → Cloud Email Gateway Protection → Outbound Protection**.

The policy rules are displayed in a table, sorted by the order in which the policy rules were created by default.
