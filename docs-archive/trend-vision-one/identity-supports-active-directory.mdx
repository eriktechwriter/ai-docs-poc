# Identity Inventory supports Active Directory (on-premises)

January 6, 2025—Identity Inventory, part of the Identity Security app group, now supports Active Directory (on-premises) as an IdP. Connect your Active Directory server to Trend Vision One and enable read and write permissions to begin syncing your Active Directory identity data and getting more visibility into the identities in your environment.
