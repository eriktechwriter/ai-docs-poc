# Logon access control

Trend Micro Business Account can determine the clients that are allowed to access the End User Console and resources within Cloud Email Gateway Protection by specifying a list of approved IP addresses. The Business Account can also specify the action to take on the access request from an unapproved IP address.

With this feature enabled:

- Only end users from the approved IP addresses can be authorized to log on to the End User Console (either through local account or SSO), activate their accounts, and perform digest inline actions.

- For the access request from an unapproved IP address, Cloud Email Gateway Protection can allow access without IP address check, allow access but record audit logs, or block access and record audit logs, depending on your access control settings.

The **Logon Access Control** screen includes the following tabs:

- **Access Control Settings**: Displays the access control settings that you want to apply to the access requests from unapproved IP addresses.

- **Approved IP Addresses**: Lists the IP addresses from which the access to Cloud Email Gateway Protection are always allowed.
