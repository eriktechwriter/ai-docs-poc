4.  Select the policy to enable automatically when the access grant is complete.

6.  In the new browser tab that appears, click your Google Super Admin account.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

If for some reason the access token becomes invalid, a notification appears on **Dashboard**. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also sends an email message to notify the administrator of this event. To continue using the service account, go to **Administration → Service Account** to create a new access token. For more information, see [Service account](service-account-cloud-apps.mdx).
