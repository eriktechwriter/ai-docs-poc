# Future Enhancements - AI Docs POC

This document tracks potential enhancements and features beyond the core 4-phase roadmap of the AI-Centric Docs-as-Code POC.

## Development Pipeline

Following our phased approach:
- **Phase 1**: Complete MDX Documentation Site (Current)
- **Phase 2**: AI Integration and Optimization
- **Phase 3**: AI-Powered Content Generation  
- **Phase 4**: Trend Vision One Console Integration POC
- **Beyond POC**: Production implementation with dedicated resources

## VS Code Integration Enhancements

### Docusaurus-Compatible Preview Panel
**Priority**: High  
**Phase**: Beyond POC (Production)  
**Added**: Current session

**Description**: Create a VS Code preview panel that renders MDX files exactly as they appear in Docusaurus, including:
- Real-time preview of admonitions (`:::warning`, `:::note`, etc.)
- Custom Docusaurus components rendering
- Site theme and styling applied
- Hot reload on file changes

**Technical Approaches**:
1. **Embedded Browser**: Use VS Code webview API with lightweight Docusaurus dev server
2. **Component Library**: Extract Docusaurus components into standalone renderer
3. **Hybrid**: Use Docusaurus build pipeline with cached rendering

**Benefits**:
- Faster feedback loops for content creators
- Better content quality through immediate visual feedback
- Improved writer experience (no context switching)
- Enhanced enterprise adoption potential

**Implementation Notes**:
- Leverage VS Code's webview APIs
- Integrate with Docusaurus component architecture
- Consider performance implications for large documentation sites
