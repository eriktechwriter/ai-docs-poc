/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Are "Offline" agents still protected by Server & Workload Protection? Agents showing as "Offline" in the Server & Workload Protection console are still being protected according to their last known configuration. However, they will not receive any software, security or policy updates until communication with Server & Workload Protection is restored. For more information on how to bring an agent out of "Offline" status, see "Offline" agent. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
