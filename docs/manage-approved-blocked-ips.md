 Managing approved and blocked IP addresses You can configure approved and blocked lists at the IP address or country/region level. The following table lists the tasks available to manage approved and blocked IP addresses. Note Tasks that apply to IP addresses also apply to IPv4 address / CIDR blocks. Tasks Location Steps Bypassing Spam Detection Only the Approved IP Address tab Select Bypass spam detection for approved IP addresses. Searching IP Addresses The Approved IP Address tab The Blocked IP Address tab Type an IP address in the search box. Click Search. Note The search box has an auto-complete feature that you can use to manually type a CIDR block. In detail, Cloud Email Gateway Protection autocompletes your input based on the CIDR addressing format if you accidentally type only the first several octets of an IP address before clicking Search. For example, if you type 16 and click Search, Cloud Email Gateway Protection automatically changes your input into 16.0.0.0/8 and lists all IP addresses whose first octet is 16.
