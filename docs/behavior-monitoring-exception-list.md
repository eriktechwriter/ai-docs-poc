/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Behavior Monitoring Exception List The Behavior Monitoring exception list contains programs that the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent does not monitor using Behavior Monitoring. Approved Programs: The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent allows all programs in the Approved Programs list to pass Behavior Monitoring scanning. Note Although Behavior Monitoring does not take action on programs added to the Approved Programs list, other scan features (such as file-based scanning) continue to scan the program before allowing the program to run. Blocked Programs: The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent blocks all programs in the Blocked Programs list. To configure the Blocked Programs list, enable Event Monitoring. Configure the exception list from the web console. You can also grant users the privilege to configure their own exception list from the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent console.
