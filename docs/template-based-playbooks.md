Learn about creating template-based playbooks to automate and orchestrate your response to security incidents.

Trend Vision One comes with a set of predefined playbook templates. The templates provide a ready-to-use workflow that can be quickly set up to meet your needs. Some playbook templates have a fixed workflow, while others are fully customizable.

Playbook templates themselves cannot be executed. You need to create a playbook from them. Multiple playbooks can be created from the same template.

Playbook templates consist of [various node types](playbook-nodes.md) that allow you to trigger execution, define the target of the playbook, handle conditions, and carry out actions.

You can view the list of currently available playbook templates from the **Templates** tab in the **Security Playbooks** app.

:::warning[Important]
The availability of certain template-based playbook types depends on your license entitlement for the associated Trend Vision One features and the required data sources. For more information, see [Security playbooks requirements](security-playbooks-requirements.md).
