When deploying the Internet Access On-Premises Gateway, Trend Micro recommends allocating at least 200 GB of disk space for the on-premises gateway to store application and log files. Detection and activity logs are automatically uploaded to Trend Vision One unless uploading is manually disabled. Detection and activity log files are automatically purged from the on-premises gateway when the files are older than seven days or take up a total of 50 GB of disk space. Trend Vision One retains uploaded log files for up to 180 days. The following tables provide information for use when considering system sizing based on on-premises gateway performance test results. Note No services other than the Internet Access On-Premises Gateway were enabled on the Service Gateway virtual appliance during testing. The number of vCPUs and amount of RAM required to run the Service Gateway firmware are included in the vCPU and RAM totals for each sizing test. 10 Data Loss Prevention templates were enabled and used when the Data Loss Prevention feature was enabled. System sizing recommendations for on-premises gateways running in proxy server mode under the following conditions: Deployment method: VMWare ESXi through a Service Gateway virtual appliance Use: Web server traffic protection Traffic protocol: HTTPS with HTTPS inspection enabled Average traffic size: 17 KB Number of vCPU cores RAM Enabled feature set Recommended maximum network throughput Transactions per second Recommended maximum total user count 8 16 GB Internet access rules only 200 Mbps 1650 2900 8 16 GB Internet Access rules with Threat Protection 170 Mbps 1500 2600 8 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 150 Mbps 1300 2200 12 16 GB Internet access rules only 290 Mbps 2500 4400 12 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 260 Mbps 2250 3900 12 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 230 Mbps 1950 3400 24 32 GB Internet access rules only 570 Mbps 4800 8500 24 32 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 510 Mbps 4400 7800 24 32 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 400 Mbps 3300 5900 48 64 GB Internet access rules only 850 Mbps 7200 12,500 48 64 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 810 Mbps 6700 12,000 48 64 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 510 Mbps 4400 7800 System sizing recommendations for on-premises gateways running in ICAP server mode under the following conditions: Deployment method: VMWare ESXi through a Service Gateway virtual appliance Use: Web server traffic protection Average traffic size: 17 KB Number of vCPU cores RAM Enabled feature set Recommended maximum network throughput Transactions per second Recommended maximum total user count 8 16 GB Internet access rules only 150 Mbps 1250 2000 8 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 135 Mbps 1200 1900 8 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 100 Mbps 900 1500 12 16 GB Internet access rules only 200 Mbps 1700 3000 12 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 190 Mbps 1600 2900 12 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 150 Mbps 1300 2300 24 32 GB Internet access rules only 400 Mbps 3200 5600 24 32 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 380 Mbps 3000 5400 24 32 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 250 Mbps 2000 3500 48 64 GB Internet access rules only 700 Mbps 5400 10,000 48 64 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 650 Mbps 5100 9000 48 64 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 300 Mbps 2400 4500 System sizing recommendations for on-premises gateways running in ICAP server mode under the following conditions: Deployment method: VMWare ESXi through a Service Gateway virtual appliance Use: File server traffic protection Average traffic size: 100 KB Number of vCPU cores RAM Enabled feature set Recommended maximum network throughput Transactions per second Recommended maximum total user count 8 16 GB Internet access rules only 550 Mbps 650 1200 8 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 550 Mbps 650 1200 8 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 500 Mbps 600 1000 12 16 GB Internet access rules only 550 Mbps 650 1200 12 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 550 Mbps 650 1200 12 16 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 500 Mbps 600 1000 24 32 GB Internet access rules only 890 Mbps 1050 2000 24 32 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 890 Mbps 1050 2000 24 32 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 850 Mbps 1000 1800 48 64 GB Internet access rules only 900 Mbps 1100 2000 48 64 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection 900 Mbps 1100 2000 48 64 GB Internet access rules with Threat Protection and Data Loss Prevention 900 Mbps 1080 1900 Important All performance indexes dropped by approximately five percent when syslog forwarding was enabled. The recommendations for maximum network throughput and maximum total users are strongly influenced by the average traffic size during testing. Important Enabling local prompt injection service requires an additional 4 vCPU and 12GB memory for on-premises gateway to support about 6~8 concurrent tasks for prompt injection scanning. It cannot be improved by adding more CPU or memory, if you require to support more concurrent tasks, you must setup additiona on-premises gateways with the local prompt injection service Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
