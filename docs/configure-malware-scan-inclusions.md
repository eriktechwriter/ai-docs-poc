Procedure Open the properties of the malware scan configuration. Go to the Inclusions tab. Specify which directories to scan. All directories includes all file directories on an endpoint. Directory List scans only directories included in the selected list. The directory list uses patterns with a specific syntax to identify the directories to scan. (See Syntax for directory lists.) Select a list to use or select New... to create a new list. Click Edit to review or edit the selected list. Specify which files to scan. All files. Includes all files in the malware scan. File types scanned by IntelliScan. IntelliScan only scans file types that are vulnerable to infection, such as .zip or .exe. IntelliScan does not rely on file extensions to determine file type but instead reads the header and content of a file to determine whether to scan the file. Compared to scanning all files, Intelliscan reduces the number of files to scan and improves performance. File Extension List. Scan files that have a file name extension that is included in a specified list. The file extension list uses patterns with a specific syntax. (See Syntax of file extension lists.) Select a list to use or select New... to create a new list. Click Edit to review or edit the selected list. Click OK. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
