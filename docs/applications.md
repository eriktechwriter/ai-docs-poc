/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Applications Identify applications with potential security vulnerabilities that are in use within your organization. Attack Surface Discovery detects all local applications, connected SaaS applications, and public cloud applications that have been accessed by your organization's users and devices. Trend Vision One categorizes and assigns a reputation score or asset risk score to each application. The consolidated visibility of all apps in your environment helps you to identify potential vulnerabilities, continuously assess and prioritize risk, and strengthen your security posture. The following table describes the tabs available in the Applications section of Attack Surface Discovery. Tab Description Public cloud apps Displays all public cloud apps accessed by your organization's users and devices that have been active over the last 30 days Search for public cloud apps by name. Click Filter to filter cloud apps by Category, Reputation, Sanctioned state, Warnings, or Last detected time. Lower public cloud app reputation scores indicate a better overall reputation. Click Export to generate a report for the apps currently displayed on the list. Click any public cloud app name to view details in the Public cloud app profile. Select one or more public cloud apps and click Change Sanctioned/Unsanctioned to set the sanctioned status of the app. Select one or more cloud apps and click Assign Secure Access Rule to control users' access to the selected public cloud apps.

Local apps Displays all local apps with activity in the last 30 days detected in your environment by the Trend Vision One Agent or Trend Micro Mobile Security The Local app list displays the number of CVEs that affect each app. The app risk score equals the score of the highest-impact CVE for the application. Important The default permission status of an executable file is Not configured. It may take up to 12 hours for a newly discovered local app to be assessed and receive a risk score. To ensure visibility of potentially high-risk unassessed apps, apps that are still assessing are grouped with high-risk apps and displayed before high-risk apps on the local apps list. Unsupported apps are unable to receive a risk score and display a dash (-) in the Asset risk score column. Historical local app records from earlier than October 2025 do not include unsupported apps.
