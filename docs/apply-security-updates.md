 Apply component updates To remain effective at identifying new threats, your agents need periodic component updates. By default, the relays provided as part of the Server & Workload Protection service (the "Primary Tenant Relay Group") provide component updates to your agents. You can also deploy your own relays that get component updates from the Primary Tenant Relay Group and then distribute the updates to your agents. For details see How relays work. To apply updates, view statuses, and configure updates settings, see the following topics: Configure the component update source Manually retrieve component updates View the component update status View the pattern update details View and manage rule updates Configure component update settings Related information Configure the component update source Manually retrieve component updates Component update status Pattern updates Rule updates Configure component update settings Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
