/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Case Management integration with Forensics October 30, 2023—Case Management now offers integration with Forensics. This allows you to create a Forensics workspace specifically for endpoints included in a Workbench insight or alert. From there, you can perform quick responses such as isolation, Osquery, and YARA process scanning within the Forensics app. Additionally, you can gather advanced digital evidence from the endpoints in Forensics to conduct a more thorough analysis, identifying root causes and constructing an attack chain using the Forensics timeline. Once you establish the attack chain, you can add the timeline to a case to record the location of the results. Agentic SIEM & XDR → Forensics © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
