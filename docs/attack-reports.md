Reports display data for a time period that you specify. You can generate reports for particular computers, groups of computers, computers using a particular policy. You can also filter for certain event tags. For details on configuring reports, see Generate reports about alerts and other activity. One of the reports that you can generate is the Attack Report, which contains a summary table and some additional information about the most frequent events. The summary tables provides this information: Detect Mode: Numbers of events where Server & Workload Protection is configured to detect issues and log events, but not take other actions. Prevent Mode: Numbers of events where Server & Workload Protection is configured to detect issues, generate events, and take some sort of action. Total: Total of the numbers in the Detect Mode and Prevent Mode columns Ratio: Percentage of events prevented compared to total number detected Anti-Malware Passed: Server & Workload Protection detected malware and logged an event. For information on how to change the action that Server & Workload Protection takes when it detects malware, see Configure malware scans. Cleaned: Server & Workload Protection cleaned an infected file by terminating processes or deleting registries, files, cookies, or shortcuts, depending on the type of malware. Quarantined: Server & Workload Protection moved an infected file to the "identified files" folder. Deleted: Server & Workload Protection deleted an infected file. Access Denied: Server & Workload Protection prevented an infected file from being accessed, without removing the file from the system.
