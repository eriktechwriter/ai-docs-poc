 Sandbox Submission Configure and manage the Sandbox Submission module settings. Important Policies and Sandbox Submission are "Pre-release" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-Release Disclaimer before using the feature. These features are not available in all regions. Enabling Sandbox Submission requires allocating credits for each endpoint assigned to the policy. Objects submitted by Sandbox Submission do not count towards the daily reserve set in Sandbox Analysis. Sandbox Submission supports Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents deployments with Standard Endpoint Protection. Navigating between the security modules or leaving the Policy Settings screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click Save before leaving the current screen. Sandbox Submission allows agents to automatically submit suspicious objects for analysis in a secure, isolated cloud sandbox environment. You can view analysis results in Sandbox Analysis. To allow agents to submit suspicious objects for analysis, select Enable. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
