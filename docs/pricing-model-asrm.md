/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ New pricing model for Attack Surface Risk Management now available November 20, 2023—Trend Vision One now supports a new pricing model for Attack Surface Risk Management (previously Risk Insights) decoupled from XDR entitlements. Credit usage for Attack Surface Risk Management apps is calculated based on the number of assessable desktops, servers, and connected cloud accounts. Each assessed desktop or server requires 20 credits, while each connected cloud account requires 8,000 credits. If you feel the number of assets discovered by Trend Vision One is inaccurate, you can manually override the number of assessed assets and your credit usage will be recalculated. If you previously purchased a Risk Insights license, you will retain your current pricing model until the license expires. If you previously allocated credits to use Attack Surface Discovery and Threat and Exposure Management, you retain your current pricing model; however, if you disable and re-enable Attack Surface Risk Management, you will be migrated to the Attack Surface Risk Management pricing model. Regardless of the pricing model, you will retain access to Attack Surface Discovery, Threat and Exposure Management, and Cloud Security Posture. A 30-day free trial remains available for customers who have not previously started a trial of Risk Insights capabilities.
