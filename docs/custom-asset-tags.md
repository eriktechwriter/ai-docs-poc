A custom asset tag consists of a property and a value that you define. Custom asset tags allow you to add additional context to discovered assets in order to better define, organize, and filter assets according to your organization's priorities. Assign tags to an asset, and then view the tags on the associated asset profile screen or card. You may also filter assets for specific tags from the asset lists in Attack Surface Discovery.
