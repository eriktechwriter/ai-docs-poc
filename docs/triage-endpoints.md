 Triage endpoints Use Forensics to identify, prioritize, and manage attacked endpoints based on the severity and impact. You can collect detailed evidence from potentially compromised endpoints for internal investigations into critical incidents that occurred on your network and may require further attention. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, go to Agentic SIEM & XDR → Forensics. Click the name of the workspace that has the endpoints you want to triage. Select one or more endpoints from the list. Selected endpoints must all use the same operating system. Use one of the available options for triage: Run YARA Rules Run osquery The task you selected starts running After the task you executed finishes running, click View Query Results to see the results. Analyze the results to decide further actions. Note For more information, see Endpoint Response Actions. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
