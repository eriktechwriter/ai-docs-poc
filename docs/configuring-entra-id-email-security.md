 Configuring Microsoft ENTRA ID Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud based directory and identity management service. Make sure you have a valid subscription in Microsoft Entra ID that handles the sign-in process and eventually provides the authentication credentials of end users to the End User Console. Procedure On the Microsoft Entra ID management portal, select an active directory that you want to implement SSO. Click Enterprise applications in the navigation area on the left and click New application. On the Browse Microsoft Entra ID Gallery (Preview) screen, click Create your own application. On the Create your own application panel that appears on the right, specify a name for your application, for example, Trend Micro Email Security End User Console, and click Create. Under Getting Started in the overview of your application, click 1. Assign users and groups, click Add user/group, select a specific user or group for this application and click Assign. In the navigation area of your application, click Single sign-on. Click SAML to configure the connection from your application to Microsoft Entra ID using the SAML protocol. Under Basic SAML Configuration, click Edit, specify the identifier and reply URL, and click Save. Note Specify the identifier for your region as follows: https://euc.<domain_name>/uiserver/euc/ssoLogin Specify the reply URL for your region as follows: https://euc.<domain_name>/uiserver/euc/ssoAssert?cmpID=<unique_identifier> In the preceding and following URLs: Replace <unique_identifier> with a unique identifier. Record the unique identifier, which will be used when you create an SSO profile on the Cloud Email Gateway Protection administrator console. Replace <domain_name> with any of the following based on your location: North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific: tmes.trendmicro.com Europe and Africa: tmes.trendmicro.eu Australia and New Zealand: tmes-anz.trendmicro.com Japan: tmems-jp.trendmicro.com Singapore: tmes-sg.trendmicro.com India: tmes-in.trendmicro.com Middle East (UAE): tmes-uae.trendmicro.com Click No, I'll test later when you are prompted to choose whether to test single sign-on with Trend Micro Email Security End User Console. You are advised to perform a test after all SSO settings are complete. Under User Attributes & Claims, click Edit, and specify the identity claim. User attributes and claims are used to get the email addresses of logon accounts to authenticate their identity.

On the Manage claim screen, specify the claim name, leave Namespace empty, select Attribute as Source, select a value from the Source attribute drop-down list, and click Save.
