 New --distro flag for Artifact Scanner March 21, 2025—Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) now supports the new --distro flag, which allows you to specify OS distribution details for file and directory artifacts. This ensures accurate vulnerability matching for open-source RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) files that sometimes do not include OS information. For more information, see the WHATS-NEW.md file included with the binary and the --distro flag information in Artifact Scanner CLI.
