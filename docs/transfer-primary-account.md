title: Transferring ownership of the Primary User Account
---

Transfer ownership of the Primary User Account to a local account within the same business.

In situations where the current Primary User Account holder is either departing the organization or transitioning to a different role, the ability to reassign the account to another user account ensures continuity in managing the system. By transferring the ownership of the Primary User Account, an organization can mitigate risks associated with having a single point of failure.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration â†’ User Accounts**.

2.  On the **User Accounts** screen, click the account whose account type is ****Primary User Account**.**

3.  In the **User Account Details** panel, click **Transfer ownership of Primary User Account**.

    :::note
    The **Transfer ownership of Primary User Account** operation is not available when the current Primacy User Account is associated with another business ID or is also an end user of a Trend Vision One app.
    :::

4.  Review the requirements and impacts associated with the transfer operation and click **Next**.

5.  Verify your email address by typing the verification code sent to your email address.

6.  Select a local account that is currently not the Trend Vision One Primary User Account for your business, and click **Complete Transfer**.

    Both the old and new Primary User Accounts are signed out of the Trend Vision One console. To regain access to the console, sign in using the credentials.

    After sign in, the new Primary User Account has the Master Administrator role and can access all Trend Vision One apps and features. The new Primary User Account can also manage Trend Micro offerings of the business.

    The role previously held by the new Primary User Account is reassigned to the old Primary User Account.
