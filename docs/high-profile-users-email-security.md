 High profile users In Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, a fraudster impersonates a high profile executive, for example, the CEO or CFO, and attempts to trick an employee, a customer, or a vendor into transferring funds or sensitive information to the fraudster. Cloud Email Gateway Protection allows you to add high profile users who are likely to be impersonated for detection and classification. Cloud Email Gateway Protection also integrates with Trend Micro's Writing Style DNA as an additional layer of protection for your organization's users against BEC threats.
