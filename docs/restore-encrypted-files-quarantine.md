 How do I restore encrypted files from quarantine? Restore files encrypted and quarantined by the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent. WARNING Restoring an infected file can spread the virus/malware to other files and computers. Before restoring the file, isolate the infected endpoint and move important files on this endpoint to a backup location. How the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent handles the process of quarantining and encrypting malware files depends on the Protection Manager—Standard Endpoint Protection or Server & Workload Protection. "Sensor-only" Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents do not quarantine malware. For Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents with Standard Endpoint Protection, the Group Manager (Trend Micro Apex One server) handles management of quarantined files. To restore quarantined files, see Trend Success Portal: Restoring files that have been quarantined by Apex One. For Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents with Server & Workload Protection, your agents store quarantined files on the endpoint. To restore quarantined files, see View and restore identified malware. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
