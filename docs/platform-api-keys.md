The API Keys app offers a centralized location to create and manage your API keys, which can be used to access the Trend Vision One public APIs or third-party app integrations, like Splunk or QRadar.

From the API Keys app, you can create API keys, which enable third-party applications to connect with Trend Vision One APIs. The API keys are not attached to specific accounts, so you do not need to enter your user account email to create a new API key.

:::note
API keys that were moved from the User Accounts app cannot be edited.

The following table outlines the actions available in the **API Keys** screen (**Administration â†’ API Keys**).
