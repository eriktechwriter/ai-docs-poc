 Remove relay functionality from an agent You might want to convert a relay back to being an ordinary agent if: Too many relays are causing communication delays Relays don't meet minimum system requirements to be a relay anymore To convert a relay to a regular agent: Procedure Go to Administration → Updates → Relay Management. Select the arrow next to the relay group whose relay you want to convert back to an agent. Select the computer. Select Remove Relay. Next steps The agent status changes to "Disabling" and the relay functionality is removed from the agent. This can take up to 15 minutes to complete. If the agent is in the "Disabling" state for longer than that, you can deactivate and reactivate the agent to finish removing the relay feature. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
