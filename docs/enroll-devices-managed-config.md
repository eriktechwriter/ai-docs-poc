/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Integration with other MDMs through managed configuration Mobile Security allows you to enroll devices managed by any MDM solution that supports managed configuration. Users that already have an MDM solution or do not wish to integrate a supported MDM solution directly with Mobile Security can still protect their devices by setting up managed configuration in the MDM solution. Mobile Security works with any MDM solution that supports managed configuration, including: Ivanti (MobileIron) ManageEngine IBM MaaS360 Once integrated with the MDM solution, Mobile Security secures enrolled iOS and Android devices using the Mobile Security for Business app. Setting up managed configuration allows you to automatically deploy the app directly to managed devices. Devices with the Mobile Security for Business app may also use the security features of Zero Trust Secure Access once the necessary settings are configured. Important If you manage both iOS and Android devices with your MDM solution, you must configure settings for both types of device in order to enroll all devices in Mobile Security.
