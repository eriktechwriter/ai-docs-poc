 Configure the security level Web addresses that are known to be or are suspected of being malicious are assigned a risk level of: Dangerous: Verified to be fraudulent or known sources of threats Highly suspicious: Suspected to be fraudulent or possible sources of threats Suspicious: Associated with spam or possibly compromised Security levels determine whether Server & Workload Protection will allow or block access to a URL, based on the associated risk level. For example, if you set the security level to low, Server & Workload Protection will only block URLs that are known to be web threats. As you set the security level higher, the web threat detection rate improves but the possibility of false positives also increases. Use the following steps to configure the security level settings. Procedure Go to Policies. Double-click the policy that you want to edit. Click Web Reputation → General. Select one of the following security levels: High: Blocks pages that are Dangerous, Highly suspicious, and Suspicious. Medium: Blocks pages that are Dangerous and Highly suspicious. Low: Blocks pages that are Dangerous. Click Save. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
