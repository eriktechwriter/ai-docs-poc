/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 4.1.4 - Minimize access to create pods (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 The ability to create pods in a namespace can provide a number of opportunities for privilege escalation, such as assigning privileged service accounts to these pods or mounting hostPaths with access to sensitive data (unless Pod Security Policies are implemented to restrict this access). As such, access to create new pods should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users. The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up possibilities for privilege escalation and should be restricted, where possible. Note By default, the following list of principals have create privileges on pod objects.

Audit Review the users who have create access to pod objects in the Kubernetes API. Remediation Where possible, remove create access to pod objects in the cluster. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
