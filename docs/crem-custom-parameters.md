 Custom parameters supported for all risk events May 5, 2025—When creating new rules for risk events or managing risk events in Event Rule Management, you can now set up to five custom parameters for a rule. Available parameters include IP address matches, users, devices, time and date, and more. When all parameters for a rule are met, the rule automatically marks the associated risk event as Remediated, Accepted, or Dismissed. You can add, edit, or remove parameters for your event rules at any time in Event Rule Management. Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Threat and Exposure Management © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
