 Reordering the Policy List Administrators can use the Reorder button to change the order of the filtered policies. Rearranging the policy list can affect target allocation. Trend Micro Apex Central may re-assign some targets to different filtered policies. Note Specified policies remain static and always take priority over filtered policies. This function is only available for managing Apex One settings. Procedure Go to Policies → Policy Management. The Policy Management screen appears. Select the type of product settings from the Product list. The screen refreshes to display policies created for the selected managed product. Click Reorder. The Reorder Policies screen appears. Rearrange the order of the Priority column. Click Save. Note After clicking Save, please wait two minutes for Trend Micro Apex Central to re-assign the targets. Click Refresh on the Policy Management screen to update the status information in the policy list. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
