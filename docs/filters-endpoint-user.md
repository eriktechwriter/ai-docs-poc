 Filters Filters automatically group users or endpoints having the same criteria. You can group Users and Endpoints based on custom filters and importance. For more information, see Creating a Custom Filter and User or Endpoint Importance. In addition, the Endpoints tree can group endpoints based on default filters. For more information, see Default Endpoint Filters. Any Trend Micro Apex Central user account that has permission to create or modify custom tags, filters, or important labels in the User/Endpoint Directory can view or modify custom tags, filters, or important labels created by all other user accounts.
