 3.2.5 - Ensure that the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not set to 0 (automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Worker Node This recommendation stresses the importance of setting timeouts on streaming connections to the Kubelet to mitigate risks associated with Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, inactive connections, and depletion of ephemeral ports. Properly configuring these timeouts ensures the secure and efficient operation of network connections. Impact Long-lived connections could be interrupted. Audit Audit method 1: Note Kubelets can be configured via a configuration file or command line arguments. Command line arguments take precedence. Check both command line arguments and configuration file entries when auditing Kubelet configurations. SSH into each node and run the following command to view details of the active Kubelet process: ps -ef | grep kubelet If the command line for the process includes the argument --streaming-connection-idle-timeout, verify that it is not set to 0. If the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not present, refer instead to the --config argument that specifies the location of the Kubelet config file: cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json Open the Kubelet config file: sudo less /path/to/kubelet-config.json Verify that the streamingConnectionIdleTimeout argument is not set to 0. Audit method 2: If using the API configz endpoint, consider searching for the status of "streamingConnectionIdleTimeout": "4h0m0s" by extracting the live configuration from the nodes running Kubelet. Set the local proxy port and the following variables and provide proxy port number and node name: export HOSTNAME_PORT=localhost:8001 export NODE_NAME=my-node-name curl -sSL "http://${HOSTNAME_PORT}/api/v1/nodes/${NODE_NAME}/proxy/configz" Remediation Method 1: If modifying the Kubelet config file, edit the /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json file: { "streamingConnectionIdleTimeout": "4h0m0s" } You should ensure that the kubelet service file /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf does not specify a --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument because it would override the Kubelet config file. Based on your system, restart the kubelet service and check status: systemctl daemon-reload systemctl restart kubelet.service systemctl status kubelet -l Method 2: If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf on each worker node and add the below parameter at the end of the KUBELET_ARGS variable string: --streaming-connection-idle-timeout=4h0m0s Based on your system, restart the kubelet service and check status: systemctl daemon-reload systemctl restart kubelet.service systemctl status kubelet -l Method 3: If using the API configz endpoint, consider searching for the status of "streamingConnectionIdleTimeout" by extracting the live configuration from the nodes running kubelet. kubectl proxy --port=8001 & export HOSTNAME_PORT=localhost:8001 export NODE_NAME=ip-192.168.31.226.ec2.internal curl -sSL "http://${HOSTNAME_PORT}/api/v1/nodes/${NODE_NAME}/proxy/configz" Based on your system, restart the kubelet service and check status: systemctl daemon-reload systemctl restart kubelet.service systemctl status kubelet -l Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
