 Recommendation scans Server & Workload Protection can run recommendation scans on computers to help identify which rules you should apply or remove for Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection. The resulting recommendations are a good place to start when establishing security rules. However, you may need additional rules for common vulnerabilities. You can exclude a rule or application type from recommendation scans and manually assign rules as well as automatically implement recommendations. Agents that support the enhanced recommendation scan display next to Agent on the Overview page. Agents that do not meet the requirements for the enhanced recommendation scan automatically use the classic recommendation scan instead. Recommendation information is not available on the policy pages.
