 Copying Policy Settings Administrators can copy the settings from an existing policy, create a new policy with the same settings, and deploy the settings to different endpoints or managed products. Note It is not possible to copy the settings of a child Apex One Agent policy. To determine whether the Apex One Agent policy is a child or a parent, check the Parent Policy column. A clickable value displays if the policy is a child, and N/A if otherwise. Procedure Go to Policies → Policy Management. The Policy Management screen appears. Select the type of product settings from the Product list. The screen refreshes to display policies created for the selected managed product. Select a policy from the list. Click Copy Settings. The Copy and Create Policy screen appears. In the Policy Name field, type a name for the policy. Assign Targets to the policy. (Optional) Change settings as necessary. Click Deploy. Note After clicking Deploy, please wait two minutes for Trend Micro Apex Central to deploy the policy to the targets. Click Refresh on the Policy Management screen to update the status information in the policy list. Trend Micro Apex Central enforces the policy settings on the targets every 24 hours. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
