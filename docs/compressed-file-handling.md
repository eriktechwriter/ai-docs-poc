 Compressed file handling Compressed files provide a number of special security concerns. Compressed files can be password-protected or encrypted, can harbor so-called "zip-of-death" security risks, and can contain numerous compression layers. Related information Compression types Compression types Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection extracts and scans files compressed using the most popular compression types (listed below). Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection also checks for malware "smuggled" within nested compressions. Example: An infected file that is zipped, ARJ-compressed, MS-compressed, and zipped again. Note Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports scanning up to 5 recursive compression layers maximum.
