 Get started with Network Security Accessing Network Security for the first time. When accessing Network Security for the first time, the introductory screen appears. Click Get Started to provision Network Security. Once Network Security is provisioned, you can access the screens for Network Inventory, Network Analysis Configuration, and Intrusion Prevention Configuration. To start utilizing the detection and response capabilities within Network Security, deploy or connect a Trend Micro network security product. To deploy a Virtual Network Sensor, see Virtual Network Sensor deployment guides. To connect a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, see Deep Discovery Inspector connection guides. To connect your TippingPoint SMS, see TippingPoint SMS connection guides. Note For new customers, Network Security no longer supports connecting Deep Discovery Director to Network Inventory. If you have a valid XDR Add-On: Deep Discovery Inspector license, your license is converted into credits so you can connect Deep Discovery Inspector appliances and enable the Network Sensor. If you have already connected Deep Discovery Director to Network Inventory, your connection is unaffected and you can continue to use Deep Discovery Director to connect your Deep Discovery Inspector appliances. For more information, see Network Inventory with Deep Discovery Director.
