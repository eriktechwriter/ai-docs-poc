Accessing Network Security for the first time.

When accessing **Network Security** for the first time, the introductory screen appears. Click **Get Started** to provision **Network Security**.

Once **Network Security** is provisioned, you can access the screens for [Network Inventory](network-inventory.md), and [Network Analysis Configuration](network-analysis-configuration.md).

To start utilizing the detection and response capabilities within **Network Security**, deploy or connect a Trend Micro network security product.

- To connect a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, see [Deep Discovery Inspector connection guides](ddi-connection-deployment.md).

:::note
For new customers, **Network Security** no longer supports connecting Deep Discovery Director to **Network Inventory**. If you have a valid "XDR Add-On: Deep Discovery Inspector" license, your license is converted into credits so you can connect Deep Discovery Inspector appliances and enable the Network Sensor.
