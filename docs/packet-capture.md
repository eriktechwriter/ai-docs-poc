---

Manage criteria to capture network packets associated with specified network detections.

Enabling packet capture allows capturing of TCP/UDP packets not only for detection traffic, but also other traffic associated with the specified client that initiated the connection, or the specified server that connected with the client within the time that detection happens.

:::warning[Important]
The packet capture feature in **Network Security** only supports Deep Discovery Inspector version 6.7 or later.

Packet capture increases processor and disk space usage on enabled appliances.

Enabling packet capture requires the appliance to restart. Disabling packet capture does not require a restart.
:::

To enable and configure your packet capture rules, see [Configuring Packet Capture](configuring-packet-capture.md).
