 Integrating OpenLDAP and SSO for Zero Trust Secure Access Integrate with OpenLDAP to authenticate user access attempts and take action on risky account activity. OpenLDAP integration requires the use of a Service Gateway, third-party integration settings, and SSO. Important You cannot configure single sign-on (SSO) from multiple IAMs. Ensure that you configure the necessary permissions and SSO on the IAM you want to use for Private Access and Internet Access authentication. Procedure Prepare a VMware ESXi or Microsoft Hyper-V Service Gateway appliance that connects to your on-premises OpenLDAP server. Go to Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Identity and Access Management. Connect your OpenLDAP server to Trend Vision One by configuring OpenLDAP integration. Integrate your LDAP service with a SAML-based SSO solution like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Microsoft Entra ID, or Okta. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
