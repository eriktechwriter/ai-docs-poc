 VPN and Accessibility Service compatibility The Zero Trust Secure Access (ZTSA) mobile solution leverages standard network-control mechanisms available on mobile platforms: iOS: Uses the local VPN Android: Uses the local VPN and Accessibility Service (mainly for personal profile scenarios) Compatibility with banking apps Some banking applications may restrict access when they detect the presence of a VPN or Accessibility Service. This is due to the security policies of the banking apps, and is not caused by any malfunction or limitation of the ZTSA solution. Important These restrictions are external to ZTSA and reflect the security enforcement mechanisms of third-party apps. Users should be aware that enabling ZTSA Internet Access may affect how certain banking apps work. For any issues, please contact the Trend Micro support team. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
