Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own Node API object, and only modify Pod API objects that are bound to their node. Note By default, NodeRestriction is not set. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes NodeRestriction.
