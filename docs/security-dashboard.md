Learn about the widgets that provide an at-a-glance perspective into your organization's overall cybersecurity strength.

The following table outlines the default widgets displayed on the **Overview** dashboard in the **Security Dashboard** app (**Dashboards and Reports → Security Dashboard**). You can create new dashboards and personalize the widgets that display for your account.

For more information, see [Customize the security dashboard](customizing-security-dashboard.md).
