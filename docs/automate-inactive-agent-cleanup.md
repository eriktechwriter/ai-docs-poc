 Automate offline computer removal with inactive agent cleanup Important As of March 3, 2025, Inactive Agent Cleanup and Inactive Agent Cleanup Overrides are disabled in Server & Workload Protection. To manage inactive agent removal, go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Inventory, click the Global Settings icon (), and go to the Endpoint Settings tab. Inactive agents are those deployed agents which have not communicated with Server & Workload Protection recently. Agents become inactive if the protected computer is offline for an extended period of time, or if you have uninstalled the agent. You can automate inactive agent removal by configuring Global Settings in Endpoint Inventory. For more information, see Endpoint Settings. Computers located in your connected cloud accounts are typically removed automatically when deleted from your cloud environment.
