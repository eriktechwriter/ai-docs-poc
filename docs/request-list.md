 Request list Track and manage all the response action requests submitted by the Managed Services operations team. Managed Services sends response action requests for your manual approval if you disable auto approval. You can choose either of the following ways to deal with the response action requests: Approve or reject a request directly in the email notification without accessing the Trend Vision One console. Get an overview of all requests and manage one or more requests on the Request List screen. Note Managed Services retains the response action requests for 60 days after submission. The following table outlines the actions you can perform on the response action requests. Action Description View request details To expand response action details, click the right arrow () next to Status. To further examine each task in Response Management, click the Task ID. Filter requests Use the Status or Action filter and type response target keywords in the search box. Approve or reject requests Select one or more requests and click Approve or Reject. Set approved requests to expire Note This operation is available only to the Remote Shell action requests. A Remote Shell action request has a validity period once approved. You can set the request to expire before that end time. Select one or more approved requests and click Set to Expire. This changes the Status of the selected request to Expired. A new request is required to start another remote shell session. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
