Select Enable Device Control. Under Devices, select a permission for each storage device. For details about permissions, see Permissions for Storage Devices. (Optional) If the permission for USB storage devices is Block, you can configure a list of approved devices under USB Storage Device Approved List. Users can access these devices and you can control the level of access using permissions. Type the device vendor. Type the device model and serial ID. Select the permission for the device. For details about permissions, see Permissions for Storage Devices. Note USB storage devices on the approved list must have a higher permission level than the permission setting for USB storage devices in the Devices section. Under Notification, select the Display a notification message on the agent endpoint when a new device is detected option to display a notification when a new storage device is connected to the endpoint. The notification indicates the access permission for the new storage device. Click Deploy. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
