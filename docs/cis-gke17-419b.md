/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 4.1.9 - Avoid non-default bindings to system:unauthenticated (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 Avoid non-default ClusterRoleBindings and RoleBindings with the group system:unauthenticated, except the ClusterRoleBinding system:public-info-viewer. Kubernetes assigns the group system:unauthenticated to API server requests that have no authentication information provided. Binding a role to this group gives any unauthenticated user the permissions granted by that role and is strongly discouraged. Default value: ClusterRoleBindings with group system:unauthenticated: system:public-info-viewer No RoleBindings with the group system:unauthenticated. Impact Unauthenticated users will have privileges and permissions associated with roles associated with the configured bindings. Care should be taken before removing any non-default clusterrolebindings or rolebindings from the environment to ensure they were not required for operation of the cluster. Leverage a more specific and authenticated user for cluster operations. Audit Both CusterRoleBindings and RoleBindings should be audited. Use the following command to confirm there are no non-default ClusterRoleBindings to group system:unauthenticated: $ kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o json | jq -r '["Name"], ["-----"], (.items[] | select((.subjects | length) > 0) | select(any(.subjects[]; .name == "system:unauthenticated")) | [.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name]) | @tsv' Only the following default ClusterRoleBinding should be displayed: Name ----- system:public-info-viewer If any non-default bindings exist, review their permissions with the following command and reassess their privilege. $ kubectl get clusterrolebinding [CLUSTER_ROLE_BINDING_NAME] -o json \ | jq ' .roleRef.name +" " + .roleRef.kind' \ | sed -e 's/"//g' \ | xargs -l bash -c 'kubectl get $1 $0 -o yaml' Confirm that there are no RoleBindings including the system:unauthenticated group: $ kubectl get rolebindings -A -o json \ | jq -r '["Namespace", "Name"], ["---------", "-----"], (.items[] | select((.subjects | length) > 0) | select(any(.subjects[]; .name == "system:unauthenticated")) | [.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name]) | @tsv' There should be no RoleBindings listed. If any bindings exist, review their permissions with the following command and reassess their privilege. $ kubectl get rolebinding [ROLE_BINDING_NAME] --namespace [ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE] -o json \ | jq ' .roleRef.name +" " + .roleRef.kind' \ | sed -e 's/"//g' \ | xargs -l bash -c 'kubectl get $1 $0 -o yaml --namespace [ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE]' Remediation Identify all non-default clusterrolebindings and rolebindings to the group system:unauthenticated. Check if they are used and review the permissions associated with the binding using the commands in the Audit section above or refer to GKE documentation. Strongly consider replacing non-default, unsafe bindings with an authenticated, user-defined group. Where possible, bind to non-default, user-defined groups with least-privilege roles. If there are any non-default, unsafe bindings to the group system:unauthenticated, proceed to delete them after consideration for cluster operations with only necessary, safer bindings. kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [CLUSTER_ROLE_BINDING_NAME] kubectl delete rolebinding [ROLE_BINDING_NAME] --namespace [ROLE_BINDING_NAMESPACE] Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
