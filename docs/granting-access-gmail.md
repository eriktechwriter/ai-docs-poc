/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Granting access to Gmail This section describes how to grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection access to Gmail. During the access grant, a service account is created for Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection to access your Gmail environment. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection accesses Gmail through the OAuth 2.0 flow. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports two protection modes for Gmail. For more details, see Protection modes for email services. Each mode requires separate access grant. Protection Mode Access Grant API-based Protection See Granting access to Gmail. Inline Protection See Granting access to Gmail (inline mode). Note Currently, Inline Protection only protects inbound messages for Gmail. You can choose to have both or either of the protection types for your Gmail service based on your requirements.
