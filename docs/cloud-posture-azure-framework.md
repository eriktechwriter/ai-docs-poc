/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Cloud Risk Management to support latest Azure framework standard March 5, 2024—The Azure Well-Architected Framework compliance standard report and associated rule mappings in Cloud Security Posture have been updated to conform with the latest version of the Azure Well-Architected Framework released in October 2023. In turn, the July 2022 version of the Azure Well-Architected Framework will no longer be available in Cloud Security Posture from June 1, 2024. The removed version will no longer be accessible in filters, preventing the creation of new reports or report configurations with the outdated standard. This means that you will no longer be able to generate new PDF or CSV reports using report configurations that include the outdated compliance standard. However, any PDF or CSV reports already created remain available for download. Trend Micro recommends that you update your report configurations to use the latest version of the framework by June 1, 2024.
