 Running the behavior anomaly network attack simulation Run a behavior anomaly simulation in Trend Vision One with one deployed Virtual Network Sensor, Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, or connected TippingPoint SMS. The behavior anomaly simulation requires that you prepare a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, Virtual Network Sensor, or TippingPoint SMS device. Procedure On the Trend Vision One console, click the Resource Center icon (). Click Simulations. Click Network Attack. The Network Attack Simulations window appears. Click to navigate to Behavior Anomaly Simulation. Select a simulation from the drop-down list. Select a network appliance from the drop-down list. Specify a client IP and server IP. Click Run simulation. Go to Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Threat and Exposure Management → Activity and behaviors → Anomaly Detections → Other events to view the results. Note Results might take an hour to appear. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
