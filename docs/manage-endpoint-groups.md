 Manage endpoint groups If you updated from Apex One as a Service or Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security, review your endpoint groups to ensure everything looks as expected. You can manage your Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection groups using the Endpoint Inventory screen. Note Endpoints which have deployed Endpoint Sensor only and are not managed by a Protection Manager cannot be added to groups. You can use the Add filters () button and search field to locate endpoints by parameters such as agent policy, device type, operating system, and more. Procedure For Standard Endpoint Protection agents: Go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Inventory. In the Endpoint Management section to the left of the list, expand your Standard Endpoint Protection Management instance. Beside your Endpoint Group Manager (previous Apex One server), click the options icon and Create a group. Specify a group name and where to add the new group in the tree. Click Create. You can also review and move agents to other groups managed by the same Endpoint Group Manager. For more information, see Endpoint Inventory. For Server & Workload Protection agents: Go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Inventory. In the Endpoint Management section to the left of the list, expand your Server & Workload Protection Management instances. Expand Computers, click the options icon next to any existing group and Create a group. Specify a group name and where to add the new group in the tree. Click Create. You can also review and move agents to other groups managed by the same Server & Workload Manager instance. For more information, see Endpoint Inventory. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
