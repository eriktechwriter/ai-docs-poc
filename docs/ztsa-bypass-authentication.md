/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Zero Trust Secure Access enables selected private IP addresses to bypass authentication on cloud and on-premises gateways March 11, 2024—You may now allow endpoints to bypass user authentication on configured cloud and on-premises gateways. To bypass user authentication, endpoints must connect using a private IP address specified by the administrator. When connecting to the internet through an Internet Access gateway, endpoints using the specified private IP addresses are included as a user in the Internet Access user count for credit calculation. This feature is not available on the default cloud gateway when connecting outside of defined locations.
