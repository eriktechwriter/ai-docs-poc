/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Schema changes for container vulnerability logs in HEC and S3 connectors May 5, 2025—We are announcing minor schema changes for container vulnerability logs in Third-Party Integration Splunk HEC and AWS S3 connectors. These changes are designed to facilitate Splunk in capturing event time from container vulnerability logs by placing the event time fields at the beginning of the logs. Users who have enabled container vulnerability logs in their AWS S3 Bucket connector may also be impacted by these changes.
