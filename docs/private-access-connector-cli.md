/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Private Access Connector CLI commands A list of available CLI commands for managing the Private Access Connector virtual appliance. To access the CLI, connect to and open the Connector virtual appliance (either directly or through SSH). Log on to the CLI with your account credentials. To view basic information of the Private Access Connector, such as network settings and service status, run the show command. For example, use show ip route to check the network IP route. For a list of available commands, type show and then press the ? key. To view a list of tasks you can perform and enable administrative commands, run the enable command. Enabling administrative commands changes the command prompt from > to #. The following table lists out the administrative commands you can use to manage the Connector virtual appliance. Command Syntax Description enable enable Enters privileged mode to enable administrative commands clear clear Clears the content on the screen exit exit Exits the session reboot reboot Restarts a Private Access Connector immediately shutdown shutdown Shuts down a Private Access Connector immediately passwd passwd Changes the password of running the enable command register register <registration_token> Registers a Private Access Connector to Trend Vision One Note This command is not available for Connectors deployed on Microsoft Azure using scale set VM deployment. unregister unregister Unregisters a Private Access Connector from Trend Vision One unregister force unregister force Forcibly unregisters a Private Access Connector from Trend Vision One register auto register auto Registers a Private Access Connector to Trend Vision One when automatic registration fails Note This command is available only for Connectors deployed on Microsoft Azure using scale set VM deployment. ifconfig ifconfig Shows information about an interface ping ping [-c num_echos] [-i interval] <dest> Checks the connection to a destination [num_echos]: Number of echo requests to be sent [-i interval]: Delay interval in seconds between each packet <dest>: Destination host name or IP address traceroute traceroute <dest> Tracks route to a destination <dest>: Destination host name or IP address resolve resolve <dest> Resolves an IP address from a host name or resolve a host name from an IP address <dest>: Destination host name or IP address proxytest proxytest Tests the connection to the proxy server show interface show interface Displays information about all interfaces in use show dpid bypass show dpid bypass Displays whether the rule enforcement function of a Private Access Connector is disabled show dns show dns Displays the DNS settings of a Private Access Connector show proxy show proxy Displays details of the proxy server connection show hostname show hostname Displays the host name of a Private Access Connector show uptime show uptime Displays the time when a Private Access Connector is up and running, as well as its load information show version show version Displays the version of a Private Access Connector show ip route show ip route Displays the routing table of a router show register show register Displays the registration status of a Private Access Connector show region show region The show region command lists the preferred, detected, and connected regions: The preferred region is the region set by the configure region command. The detected region is the closest detected region. The connected region is the region the Connector is currently connected to. The Connector uses the preferred region first when attempting to connect to a ZTNP server, if that is not possible (either by failure, or not being set) then the Connector attempts to use the detected region to connect to a ZTNP server. show timezone show timezone Displays the time zone of a Private Access Connector show timezonelist show timezonelist [country_or_region_or_city] Displays the available time zones to configure for a Private Access Connector [country_or_region_or_city]: Keyword to list the available time zones for a specific country, region, or city, for example, Africa, shanghai show time show time Displays system time show ntp server show ntp server Displays the NTP server of a Private Access Connector show ntp status show ntp status Displays the status of NTP show maintenance show maintenance Displays the current maintenance mode status configure interface ip configure interface <interface> <ip> <mask> Configures the IP address for your Ethernet interface <interface>: Name of the interface <ip>: IP address for the interface <mask>: Network mask for the interface configure hostname configure hostname <hostname> Configures the host name for a Private Access Connector <hostname>: Host name or FQDN for the Connector configure dns primary configure dns primary <dns> Configures a DNS server as the primary DNS server <dns>: IP address of a DNS server configure dns secondary configure dns secondary <dns> Configures a DNS server as the secondary DNS server <dns>: IP address of a DNS server configure no dns primary configure no dns primary Deletes the primary DNS server configure no dns secondary configure no dns secondary Deletes the secondary DNS server configure ip route configure ip route <dest> <via> <dev> Adds a static route entry for traffic to a destination network <dest>: Destination network segment, for example, 0.0.0.0/0 <via>: IP address of the default gateway <dev>: Name of your Ethernet interface For example, the default routing strategy is making all egress to gateway 192.168.232.2 through eth0 adapter: configure ip route 0.0.0.0/0 192.168.232.2 eth0 configure no ip route configure no ip route <dest> <via> <dev> Deletes the static route entry for traffic to a destination network <dest>: Destination network segment, for example, 0.0.0.0/0 <via>: IP address of the default gateway <dev>: Name of your Ethernet interface For example, to delete the default routing strategy of making all egress to gateway 192.168.232.2 through eth0 adapter: configure no ip route 0.0.0.0/0 192.168.232.2 eth0 configure dpid bypass configure dpid bypass <on/off> Disables or enables the rule enforcement function of a Private Access Connector If <on/off> is set to on, the Connector does not enforce rules to user access requests and allows all access to destinations. The default value is off. configure ping configure ping <interface> <on/off> Allows or blocks ping packages for your Ethernet interface <interface>: Name of the interface configure ssh configure ssh <interface> <on/off> Allows or blocks ssh traffic for your Ethernet interface <interface>: Name of the interface configure proxy configure proxy <proxy_addr> <proxy_port> [proxy_type] Configures a proxy server connection <proxy_addr>: FDQN or IP address of the proxy server <proxy_port>: Port of the proxy server [proxy_type]: Parameter that indicates the type of traffic the proxy server accepts. Options include: http, https, all Note If no value is specified, [proxy_type] defaults to all configure no proxy configure no proxy [proxy_type] Deletes a proxy server connection [proxy_type]: Parameter that indicates the type of traffic the proxy server accepts. Options include: http, https, all Note If no value is specified, [proxy_type] defaults to all configure dhcp configure dhcp <interface> Configures the DHCP mode for your Ethernet interface <interface>: Name of the interface configure region configure region <region code> The configure region command is used to set a preferred region for the Connector to search for a ZTNP (relay server) to connect to. Note that the region input is a free form input and thus could be invalid. The Connector will not connect to an invalid or unavailable region. Examples of valid regions are: anz (Australia) br (Brazil) ca (Canada) co (Colombia) de (Germany) eu (Europe Netherlands) in (India) is (Israel) mea (United Arab Emirates) mx (Mexico) sa (South Africa) sg (Singapore) uk (United Kingdom) us (United States East) us2 (United States West) configure timezone configure timezone <timezone> Configures the time zone for a Private Access Connector Options for <timezone> include: <region>/<city>: Sets the time zone in region/city format, for example, Asia/Shanghai Note Use show timezonelist to view available time zones.
