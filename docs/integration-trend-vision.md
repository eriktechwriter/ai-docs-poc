If your organization does not use a supported MDM solution, end users will need to manually deploy the Mobile Security for Business app to their mobile devices. The detailed process is as follows: Mobile Security sends a device enrollment invitation to the end users whose mobile devices need protection. After receiving the invitation, the users download and install the Mobile Security for Business from Google Play or App Store and sign in to the Mobile Security for Business with their company accounts. To enable the manual enrollment, you need to integrate with Microsoft Entra ID in order to send the mobile device enrollment invitation to end users.
