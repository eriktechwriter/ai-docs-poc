title: Required settings on supported products
---

Supported Trend Micro products have prerequisite settings that enable the Trend Vision One console to access data necessary for advanced detections and alerts.

Trend Vision One correlates data received from connected products and assesses your environment for advanced threats. After detecting a possible threat, Trend Vision One generates an alert and allows you to begin an investigation.

Each connected product can only transfer the necessary detection and activity data if properly configured. You must configure all required settings in connected products to receive the greatest benefits from your Trend Vision One service.
