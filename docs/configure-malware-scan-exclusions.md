 Configure malware scan exclusions Exclude directories, files, and file extensions from the malware scan. For real-time scans, you can also exclude process image files. Examples of files and folders to exclude: If you are creating a malware scan configuration for a Microsoft Exchange server, exclude the SMEX quarantine folder to avoid re-scanning files that have already been confirmed to be malware. If you have large VMware images, exclude the directory containing these images if you experience performance issues. Tip You can also exclude files from Anti-Malware scanning when they are signed by a trusted digital certificate. This type of exclusion is defined in policy or computer settings. (See Exclude files signed by a trusted certificate.) To exclude directories, files, and process image files, create a list that uses patterns to identify the item to exclude.
