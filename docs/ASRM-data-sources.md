To enable Cyber Risk Exposure Management capabilities, including asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, and risk event detection, you must have one or more Trend Micro or third-party data sources connected to Trend Vision One. The Cyber Risk Exposure Management section in Data usage and monitoring under Data Source and Log Management displays supported data sources along with the connection status and data target. For details on all supported Cyber Risk Exposure Management data sources, see Configure Cyber Risk Exposure Management data sources. Important No additional credits are required for ingestion of Trend native data sources, including data from third-party sources connected directly to Trend Vision One and collected by Trend native sensors.
