 Data Loss Prevention Templates A DLP template combines DLP data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements. Only files or data that satisfy a certain condition statement will be subject to a DLP policy. For example, a file must be a Microsoft Word file (file attribute) AND must contain certain legal terms (keywords) AND must contain ID numbers (expressions) for it to be subject to the "Employment Contracts" policy. This policy allows Human Resources personnel to transmit the file through printing so that the printed copy can be signed by an employee. Transmission through all other possible channels, such as email, is blocked. You can create your own templates if you have configured DLP data identifiers. You can also use predefined templates. For details, see Custom DLP templates and Predefined DLP Templates. Note It is not possible to delete a template that is being used in a DLP policy. Remove the template from the policy before deleting it. Related information Predefined DLP Templates Custom DLP templates Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
