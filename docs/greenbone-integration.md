Integrate your Greenbone Enterprise Appliance with Trend Vision one through a Service Gateway to increase your visibility into vulnerabilities on your network.

Enable Trend Vision One to receive data from your Greenbone Enterprise Appliance to gain deeper insight into the apps and devices your users access and vulnerabilities they may contain.

Through Greenbone integration, you gain access to the following insightful reports:

- Operating systems containing CVEs

- Applications containing CVEs

:::note
At least one Service Gateway must be configured to enable integration.
