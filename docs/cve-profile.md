Mitigation Options Provides a set of recommended actions curated by Trend Micro threat experts that you can use to mitigate the selected vulnerability on applicable operating systems. For some supported platforms, Trend Vision One automatically detects completed mitigation actions, sets the CVE status to Mitigated, and removes affected devices from the affected devices list. CVEs on some platforms are not supported for automatic detection, which means any mitigated devices may still remain on the affected devices list. Trend Micro still recommends you to complete mitigation actions on unsupported platforms to strengthen your security posture.
