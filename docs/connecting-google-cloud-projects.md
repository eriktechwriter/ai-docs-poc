/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Connecting Google Cloud projects Add your Google Cloud (GCP) projects to provide visibility into your cloud environment. Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with sufficient privileges for the project you wish to connect. For best results, sign into the project on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. Review the required permissions to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources. If you plan to enable Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection, determine whether you want to use a sidecar project and if you want Trend Vision One to automate the process. For more information, see Get started with Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection in Google Cloud. Follow the links based on your project or deployment type: To connect Google Cloud projects, see Adding a Google Cloud project. To update a legacy Google Cloud connection, see Updating a legacy Google Cloud connection.
