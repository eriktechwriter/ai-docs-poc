/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Kubernetes system requirements for Container Security Before deploying Container Security, ensure that your Kubernetes clusters meet the minimum system requirements and specific Helm and network policy requirements. Note Container Security supports each Kubernetes version until its official end-of-life (EOL). Container Security supports each Helm version for up to 6 months. The latest three versions are always supported. System requirements Features Enabled Min. vCPU Request Max vCPU Limit Min. Memory Request Max Memory Limit Default features 0.6 vCPU 3.4 vCPU 572 MB 4 GB Runtime security enabled 06 vCPU + 0.2 vCPU per node 3.4 vCPU + 2 vCPU per node 572 MB + 768 MB per node 4GB + 2GB per node Runtime scanning enabled 0.7 vCPU 4.4 vCPU 592 MB 5GB Both features enabled 0.7 vCPU + 0.2 vCPU per node 4.4vCPU + 2 vCPU per node 592 MB + 768 MB per node 5 GB + 2 GB per node Help and network policy requirements Requirement Description Helm 3 (or later) Container Security components use the helm package manager for Kubernetes. Network policy support Container Security continuous compliance enforces policies by leveraging Kubernetes network policies to perform isolation mitigation. Network policies are implemented by a network plugin. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) : Calico network plugin OpenShift versions 4.12 and later: OpenShift SDN Note Ensure that your environment supports Container Security before deploying alongside OpenShift. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Azure Network Policies or Calico. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): Network policy enforcement Note Before connecting an Amazon EKS Fargate pod, ensure that the container meets the additional system requirements for EKS Fargate deployments. If you are running Container Security in a Red Hat OpenShift environment, network isolation mitigation is only supported for pods whose security context is acceptable by the oversight controller's SecurityContextConstraint. If you want to let Container Security isolate pods that are not allowed by default, you can use the overrides.yaml file to override the default settings. Important The network policy with matchLabels trendmicro-cloud-one: isolate must exist in each application namespaces in order to perform proper isolation mitigation.
