 2.5 - Ensure that the --peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to true (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node etcd should be configured for peer authentication. etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Note This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable. Note By default, --peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to false. Impact All peers attempting to communicate with the etcd server will require a valid client certificate for authentication. Audit Run the following command on the etcd server node: ps -ef | grep etcd Verify that the --peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to true. Remediation Edit the etcd pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml on the master node and set the below parameter. --peer-client-cert-auth=true Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
