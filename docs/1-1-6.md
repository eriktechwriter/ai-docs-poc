 1.1.6 - Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to root:root (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to root:root. The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kube-scheduler service in the master node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Note By default, kube-scheduler.yaml file ownership is set to root:root. Audit Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml Verify that the ownership is set to root:root. Remediation Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
