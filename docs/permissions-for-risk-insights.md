 Permissions for Risk Insights updated July 3, 2023—To streamline the management of Risk Insights access in the User Roles app, the Configure settings and Export data permissions are no longer listed under Cyber Risk Overview, Attack Surface Discovery, and Threat and Exposure Management. Configure settings and Export data are now found in the new General category, which affects the three Risk Insights apps. The new Manage assets permission now affects Attack Surface Discovery. Threat and Exposure Management now uses two new permissions, Manage risk events and Manage vulnerabilities. Administration → User Roles © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
