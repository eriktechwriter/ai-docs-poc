 3.2.2 - Ensure ResouceQuota policy is used to limit resource usage (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 ResourceQuotas are restrictions placed on the aggregate resource usage for an entire namespace, such as limits placed on total CPU and memory usage. If a user tries to create a Pod that violates a LimitRange or ResourceQuota policy, the Pod creation fails. Audit Run the following command and review ResourceQuota policies: kubectl get resourcequotas --all-namespaces Add ResourceQuota policies to limit resource usage. Remediation Create a ResourceQuota policy with memory and CPU quota per each namespace. ResourceQuota objects to limit aggregate resource usage within a namespace are created by applying a YAML file to a namespace or specifying requirements in the configuration file of Pods. For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation. Configuration file for a namespace: apiVersion: v1 kind: ResourceQuota metadata: name: example-cpu-mem-resourcequota spec: hard: requests.cpu: “1” requests.memory: 1Gi limits.cpu: “2” limits.memory: 2Gi This ResourceQuota can be applied with: kubectl apply -f example-cpu-mem-resourcequota.yaml --namespace=<insert-namespace-here> This ResourceQuota places the following constraints on the chosen namespace. Every container must have the following: A memory request, memory limit, CPU request, and CPU limit Aggregate memory request for all containers should not exceed 1 GB Total memory limit for all containers should not exceed 2 GB Aggregate CPU request for all containers should not exceed 1 CPU Total CPU limit for all containers should not exceed 2 CPUs © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
