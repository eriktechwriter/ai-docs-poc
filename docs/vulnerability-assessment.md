/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Vulnerability Assessment Vulnerability Assessment identifies assets on your network containing CVEs that require mitigation actions. Vulnerability Assessment detects known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in supported applications, language packages, and operating systems on your managed assets. Vulnerability Assessment is automatically enabled on endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent installed. You may also connect additional third-party data sources to get increased visibility into vulnerabilities in your organization's assets. On Windows devices, Vulnerability Assessment updates between 10 minutes and 1 hour after an operating system vulnerability is patched or mitigated. Applications are scanned every ten minutes. On macOS and Linux devices, Vulnerability Assessment scans for vulnerabilities once per day. Monitor your vulnerability data in the Exposure Overview tab of Cyber Risk Overview or from the Vulnerabilities section of Threat and Exposure Management. The following table lists some of the data sources that provide vulnerability data to Trend Vision One. Note For a complete list of Trend Micro and third-party data sources and instructions on how to connect the data sources to Trend Vision One, see Configure Cyber Risk Exposure Management data sources.
