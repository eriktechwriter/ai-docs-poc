 Grouped accounts Trend Vision One™ – Cloud Risk Management provides you with the ability to organize Cloud account into Groups using account tags. This is similar to groups within the AWS organization hierarchy, except that using Cloud Risk Management you have the ability to add multiple tags to a Cloud account, and therefore a Cloud account can belong to multiple groups. Use Groups to group accounts based on environment, product, or any other parameters that are used in your workflow. The benefit of using Group is that it allows you to consume combined information. For example: Create team reports that combine your AWS accounts into a group for each team Create environment level reports e.g. Staging or Production User Access Action Master Administrator/Senior Analyst/Administrator Power User Custom - Full Access Read Only Custom - Read Only Create or edit groups View Group if you have access to at least one account within the group Note The information shown in the Groups is limited to the number of accounts a user has access to. For example: If a group has 3 accounts, but user has access to only 2 of those - User will be able to see group but with information for only the 2 accounts they have access to. Group your accounts Groups appear in the accounts navigation as a multi-account tab icon. Click Create a new group on the accounts navigation Input Group Name and type in the select or create a tag input box to use a pre-existing account tags or create a new group tag._Note: When the account tag and the group tag are the same, the account is added to the group. On selecting a tag, users will see all the accounts that will be added to the group. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
