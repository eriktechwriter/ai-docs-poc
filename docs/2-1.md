These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit. Note By default, TLS encryption is not set. Impact Client connections only over TLS would be served. Audit Run the following command on the etcd server node: ps -ef | grep etcd Verify that the --cert-file and the --key-file arguments are set as appropriate. Remediation Follow the etcd service documentation and configure TLS encryption. Then, edit the etcd pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml on the master node and set the below parameters. --cert-file=</path/to/ca-file> --key-file=</path/to/key-file> Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
