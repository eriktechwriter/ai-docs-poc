/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Active Directory (on-premises) integration and SSO for Zero Trust Secure Access Integrate with Active Directory (on-premises) to authenticate user access attempts and take action on risky account activity. Active Directory (on-premises) integration requires the use of a Service Gateway, third-party integration settings, and SSO. Procedure Prepare a VMware ESXi or Microsoft Hyper-V Service Gateway appliance that connects to your on-premises Active Directory server. Go to Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Identity and Access Management. Click Grant permissions next to Active Directory (on-premises). A new browser tab opens to the Third-Party Integration > Active Directory (on-premises) screen. Connect your Active Directory server to Trend Vision One by configuring Active Directory (on-premises) integration. Configure SSO based on the authentication protocol that your on-premises Active Directory system supports.
