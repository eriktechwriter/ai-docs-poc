 Add a quarantine folder to a mount point When you are adding or modifying a mount point, you can add a quarantine folder to each of your mounts. Each mount point has its own unique quarantine folder. They cannot be shared. When you set quarantine folder, the virtual appliance scanner moves any suspicious file into that folder. To have a quarantine folder as part of the mount point, you must create the folder on the server. When you add the mount point, it must: be a subfolder of the folder path; and it must have write access enabled. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
