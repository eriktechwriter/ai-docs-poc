/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 1.2.12 - Ensure that the admission control plugin ServiceAccount is set (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 2 - Master Node Automate service accounts management. When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens. Note By default, ServiceAccount is set. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not includes ServiceAccount. Remediation Follow the documentation and create ServiceAccount objects as per your environment. Then, edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml on the master node and ensure that the --disable-admission-plugins parameter is set to a value that does not include ServiceAccount.
