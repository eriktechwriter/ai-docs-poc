/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Email tracking log enhancement for inline protection: sender IP column added August 15, 2025—The email tracking log for Exchange Online (Inline Mode) now includes a sender IP column, showing the IP address first received by Microsoft Exchange Online. This provides enriched visibility into email origins for investigation and auditing. Note that if Trend Micro Email Security or Trend Vision One Cloud Email Gateway Protection is deployed before Microsoft Exchange Online, the sender IP shown will be the IP address received by the corresponding Trend Micro solution.
