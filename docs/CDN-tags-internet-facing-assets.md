/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Content delivery network tags added to internet-facing assets August 8, 2025—Internet-facing assets displayed in Attack Surface Discovery that are hosted by a content delivery network (CDN) are now tagged with a CDN tag in asset profiles.
