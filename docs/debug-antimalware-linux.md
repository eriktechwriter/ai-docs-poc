 Increase debug logging for Anti-Malware in protected Linux instances You can increase or decrease verbosity of the Anti-Malware (AM) debug logging used to diagnose any issue related to AM when running on a Linux operating system. Anti-Malware debug logs are automatically included when you create a diagnostic package for technical support. For information on creating a diagnostic package, see Create a diagnostic package. To increase the Anti-Malware debug log level, enter the following command in a shell on the Linux instance as a superuser: killall -USR1 ds_am This command will increase the level one unit. By default the level is 6 and the maximum is 8. To decrease the Anti-Malware debug log level, enter the following command in a shell on the Linux instance as a superuser: killall -USR2 ds_am This command decreases the level by one unit. The minimum level is 0. Note If your Linux distribution doesn't use killall you can substitute it with the pkill command. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
