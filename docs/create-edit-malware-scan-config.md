/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Create or edit a malware scan configuration Create or edit a malware scan configuration to control the behavior of a real-time, manual, or scheduled scan. (For more information, see Malware scan configurations.) You can create multiple malware scan configurations as required. After you create a malware scan configuration, you can then associate it with a scan in a policy or computer (see Select the types of scans to perform) When you edit a malware scan configuration that a policy or computer is using, the changes affect the scans that are associated with the configuration. Tip To create a malware scan configuration that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the existing configuration and then edit it. You can create two types of malware scan configurations according to the type of scan it controls (see Types of malware scans): Real-time scan configuration: Controls real-time scans. Some actions such as s are only available to real-time scan configurations. Manual/scheduled scan configuration: Controls either manual or scheduled scans. Some options such as CPU Usage are only available to manual/scheduled scan configurations. Server & Workload Protection provides a default malware scan configuration for each type of scan. Tip To see the policies and computers that are using a malware scan configuration, see the AssignedTo tab of the properties. Procedure Go to Policies → Common Objects → Other → Malware Scan Configurations. To create a scan configuration, click New and then click New Real-Time Scan Configuration or New Manual/Scheduled Scan Configuration. Type a name to identify the scan configuration. You see the name in a list when configuring malware scans in a policy. Type a description that explains the use case for the configuration. To view and edit an existing scan configuration, select it and click Properties. To duplicate a scan configuration, select it and click Duplicate. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
