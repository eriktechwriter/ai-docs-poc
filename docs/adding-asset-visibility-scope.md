Add or edit an asset visibility scope to group the data and Trend Vision One app assets of your organization as per your requirements.

1.  Connect data assets to Trend Vision One or create app assets in the associated Trend Vision One app.

    Data assets of your organization that can be managed cover multiple layers, including endpoints, containers, accounts, cloud assets, network assets, and more. Depending on what types of assets you want to group and manage, you can connect your Trend Micro offerings in the Product Instance app or set up security solutions in the corresponding Trend Vision One apps such as Endpoint Security Operations.

3.  On the **General Information** tab, specify the scope name and description.
