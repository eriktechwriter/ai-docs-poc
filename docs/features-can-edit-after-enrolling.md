 Features editable after enrolling a Server Workload Protection endpoint group Review which settings can still be configured in Server & Workload Protection after enrolling your endpoint group in Endpoint Security Policies. When you enroll an endpoint group in Endpoint Security Policies, most features are locked in Server & Workload Protection, and cannot be changed. Due to ongoing development of feature support, some settings can be configured in the computer editor for Server & Workload Protection. Changing these features might override the policy settings or alter the behavior of the endpoint protection module.
