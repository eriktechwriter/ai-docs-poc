/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Network Resources Define your network topography to help your Network Sensors better detect threats and monitor critical resources. Network Resources provides a set of lists you can use to define your network topography. Using these lists allows your connected appliances to better identify the source of threats and recognize which critical assets in your environment require additional monitoring. You can add network resources to each list, edit the lists, import files to configure each list, or export the lists to edit them. Note When you connect your Deep Discovery Inspector appliances to Network Inventory through Deep Discovery Director, Network Resources configurations are not available. Go to the Deep Discovery Director management console to configure the corresponding settings. You can create a Network Resource profile to define more than one set of lists. Apply profiles to your network asset groups to allow more flexible monitoring of different networks or locations. To create network asset groups, see Network Inventory. If you have not created a network resource profile, accessing Network Resources opens the Base Profile. The Base Profile is the default resource list set applied to any Network Sensor not assigned a resource profile. To create a profile, click Create Network Resource Profile. After you have created a Network Resource profile, accessing Network Resources opens the Network Resource Profile List. The following table details which actions you can take from the Network Resources screen. Important If your Trend Vision One account has limited visibility, you can only see assets you have permission to view. Editing a Network Resource profile might affect assets that are not visible to your account. Talk to your system administrator for assistance.
