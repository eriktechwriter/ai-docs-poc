/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Approved SharePoint Online sites in Global Settings September 12, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports defining an approved site list for SharePoint Online in Global Settings. Files uploaded, created, synchronized, or modified on these approved sites will be excluded from scanning, allowing administrators to bypass ATP or DLP policy enforcement for trusted SharePoint Online locations. This feature helps streamline policy configuration—especially for customers managing large numbers of SharePoint Online sites—by enabling centralized exception management similar to approved Exchange Online users.
