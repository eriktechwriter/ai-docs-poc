View your account information, change your account password, and reset your two-factor authentication device.

Access the **Account Settings** screen using your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the Trend Vision One console.

To enhance your account security, Trend Micro requires using an email address as the sign-in credential to access the Trend Vision One console. If you do not have an account email yet, click **specify an email address** to add and verify your email address.
