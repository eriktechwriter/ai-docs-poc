 Define a schedule that you can apply to rules Schedules are reusable timetables that you can assign to rules, agent upgrades, and more. Procedure In the Server & Workload Protection console, go to Policies → Common Objects → Other → Schedules. Click New → New Schedule. In the General Information area, enter a name and description used to identify the schedule. Click a time block in the grid to select it. To deselect it, click it while pressing Shift. Schedule periods are defined by hour-long time blocks. Next steps After you assign the schedule to a rule, it is displayed on the Assigned To tab for the schedule. To link a security rule to a schedule, go to the Options tab in the security rule's Properties window and select the schedule from the "Schedule" list. Note Schedules use the same time zone as the protected computer's operating system. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
