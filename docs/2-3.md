/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 2.3 - Ensure that the --auto-tls argument is not set to true (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Do not use self-signed certificates for TLS. etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Note By default, --auto-tls is set to false. Impact Clients will not be able to use self-signed certificates for TLS. Audit Run the following command on the etcd server node: ps -ef | grep etcd Verify that if the --auto-tls argument exists, it is not set to true. Remediation Edit the etcd pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml on the master node and either remove the --auto-tls parameter or set it to false. --auto-tls=false Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
