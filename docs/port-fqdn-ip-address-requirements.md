 Port and FQDN/IP address requirements Configure your firewall exceptions to allow ports and FQDNs required by Zero Trust Secure Access services. Zero Trust Secure Access requires network access to communicate with your corporate applications, third-party applications, and internet gateways. You must add the required fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) or IP addresses to your firewall rules. In addition to the FQDNs and IP addresses, Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access customers need to open specific ports for the Private Access Connector. Refer to Firewall exception requirements for Trend Vision One for specific FQDN (or IP address) and port requirements. For Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access customers, the following table outlines the point-of-presence (PoP) location of the Internet Access Cloud Gateway and the associated Trend Vision One data center of each PoP.
