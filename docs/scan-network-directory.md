 Scan a network directory (real-time scan only) If you want to scan files and folders in network shares and mapped network drives that reside in a Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB) or Common Internet File System (CIFS), select Enable Network Directory Scan. This option is available only for real-time scans. Note Resources accessed in "~/.gvfs" via GVFS, a virtual file system available for the GNOME desktop, will be treated as local resources, not network drives. If a virus is detected when scanning a network folder on Windows, the agent may display some "clean failed" (delete failed) events. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
