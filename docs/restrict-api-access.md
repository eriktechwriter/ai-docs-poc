 Restrict API access with authorized IP addresses July 22, 2024—The API Keys app now enables you to define and manage a list of authorized IP addresses for accessing Trend Vision One APIs. This enhancement adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that only traffic from trusted sources can access the APIs. For more information, see API Keys (available to both customers that have updated to the Foundation Services release and those that have not).
