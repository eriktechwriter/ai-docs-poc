/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Connecting and updating Azure subscriptions Add your Azure subscriptions or update legacy connections to provide visibility into your cloud environment. Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with administrator privileges for the subscription you wish to connect, and that you are logged into the subscription on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. Review the required permissions and regional limitations to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources. Follow the links based on your subscription or deployment type: To connect a new Azure subscription, see Adding an Azure subscription. To connect multiple Azure subscriptions in a management group, see Adding an Azure Management Group. To update a legacy connection added by Cloud Security Posture and Server & Workload Protection, see Updating a legacy Azure connection. To connect or update multiple Azure subscriptions with a single app registration and service principal, see Connect or update multiple Azure subscriptions.
