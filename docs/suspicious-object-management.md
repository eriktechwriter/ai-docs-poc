You can manage the Suspicious Object List and Exception List to control the specific information for synchronization.

The Exception List has a higher priority than the Suspicious Object List. Objects may appear in both lists, but Trend Vision One calculates the list of effective suspicious objects before sending the information to connected products.

Trend Vision One currently supports sending the Suspicious Object List to the following products and services if they are connected properly:

- Endpoint Sensor agent

- Server & Workload Protection agent

- Standard Endpoint Protection agent

- Service Gateway Management

  For more information, see [Service Gateway overview](service-gateway-overview.md).

- Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access

- Trend Cloud One - Endpoint & Workload Security

- Trend Micro Apex One as a Service

- Trend Micro Apex One (on-premises)

- Trend Micro Cloud App Security

- Trend Micro Deep Discovery Email Inspector

- Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector version 6.7 SP1 or later

  :::note
  Connection with a service gateway is required for Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector version 6.7 or earlier.
