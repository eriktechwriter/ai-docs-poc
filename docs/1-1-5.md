/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 1.1.5 - Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive. The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the Scheduler service in the master node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Note By default, kube-scheduler.yaml file has permissions of 640. Audit Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive. Remediation Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
