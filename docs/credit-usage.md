/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Annual credits View detailed information about your valid credits, your credit allocation across the Trend Vision One platform, your purchase history, and all available features that require credits on the Annual credits tab. Trend Vision One credits provide a flexible and convenient way for you to enable features in Trend Vision One without purchasing individual licenses for specific offerings. For more information, see Introduction to credit-based licensing. The following table outlines the information available in the Summary section of the Annual credits tab. Total valid credits The current total number of valid credits, including both purchased Trend Vision One credits and credits converted from Trend Micro license entitlements. Allocated credits The number of credits currently allocated to Trend Vision One apps and services that require credits. Current balance The number of remaining credits available to be allocated to Trend Vision One apps and services. Note If your allocated credits exceed your total valid credits, your current balance displays a negative value. You can purchase more credits by contacting your sales representative or going to an affiliated marketplace in order to allocate additional credits to Trend Vision One apps and services. Having a negative credit balance does not prevent you from using any Trend Vision One app or service. If you are unable to access or use a feature, you might need to try again or contact your support provider.
