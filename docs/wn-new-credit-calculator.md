This tool allows you to estimate your credit requirements based on projected usage of selected solutions. You can easily determine how many credits you need overall, without doing any calculations. On the new All available solutions tab, you can view an inventory of Trend Vision One solutions that require credits, along with the description and credit requirement for each. To estimate your required credits with the credit calculator, you can select available solutions and input your projected unit usage, such as the number of cloud accounts or email users in your organization. The calculator then provides your estimated required credits, current credit balance, and recommended credit purchase. You can download a spreadsheet of the provided figures or directly contact your sales representative to purchase credits. For more information, see Credits & Billing.
