 Custom intelligence Trend Vision One allows you to build custom intelligence by importing your own reports and retrieving data from third-party intelligence sources. The following table outlines the actions available on the Custom screen. Action Description Filter intelligence reports Use the search text box and the following drop-down lists to filter custom intelligence reports: Last updated: The last date and time Trend Vision One received the reports View: The option to show only specific reports or all reports Source: The source where the reports came from Add intelligence reports Click Add and choose to import CSV and STIX files or retrieve data from third-party intelligence as custom intelligence reports. When importing CSV and STIX files, you can choose to extract suspicious object information, select a risk level, specify actions that connected products apply upon detection, and select an expiration option for the extracted objects. Note Imported CSV files are converted into STIX intelligence reports. Trend Vision One supports converting the following types of indicators from CSV files into STIX patterns: Domain File (SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5) File name IP address Process (command line) URL User account STIX files must include one or more "indicator" type STIX objects in order to be successfully imported.

Check the indicator count and matches Under Indicators for sweeping, check the number of indicators that can be used for sweeping from the intelligence report. Under Matched sweeps, check the number of tasks that have indicator matches and the total number of sweeping tasks that have been created. For example, the message 1 out of 7 means one sweeping task has indicator matches among a total of seven sweeping tasks. Note The message 0 out of 0 indicates that no sweeping task has been triggered. In addition, Trend Vision One defines a 180-day data retention period for the sweeping task history. The message underMatched sweeps will be reset to 0 out of 0 once the retention period expires.
