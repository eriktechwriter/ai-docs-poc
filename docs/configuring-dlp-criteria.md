 Configuring Data Loss Prevention criteria Cloud Email Gateway Protection evaluates email messages, including their content and attachments, against a set of rules defined in Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. Policies determine files or data that requires protection from unauthorized transmission and the action that Cloud Email Gateway Protection performs after detecting a transmission. Create DLP policies after you have configured data identifiers and organized them in templates. For details about the data identifiers and templates, see Data Loss Prevention. Procedure Choose a correct path to create your DLP policy for the proper mail traffic direction: Inbound Protection → Data Loss Prevention → Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy Outbound Protection → Data Loss Prevention → Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy Click Add to add a DLP policy. Click the Scanning Criteria tab. Select fields to scan, for example, Subject and Body. To add a customized message header field, select Other and specify the field in the text box. Select at least one compliance templates from the Available Templates list and click the right arrow button. Note A maximum of 255 compliance templates can be selected for each DLP policy. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
