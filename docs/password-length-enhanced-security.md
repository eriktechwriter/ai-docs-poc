 Minimum password length updated to 12 characters for enhanced security May 21, 2025—The minimum password length for Trend Vision One user accounts increases from 8 characters to 12 characters to align with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements and industry best practices. This change helps strengthen access control and protect against brute-force attacks. Existing passwords with less than 12 characters are still allowed for login, but newly created user accounts and updated passwords are required to meet the new minimum password length of 12 characters.
