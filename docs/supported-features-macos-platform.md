 Supported features by macOS platform The tables below list the security features available for each macOS platform of Deep Security Agent 20.0. Older agents are compatible with other platforms (although they don't support new features). See the list of agents compatible with Server & Workload Protection, and list of supported features on each platform: Deep Security Agent 12 supported features Deep Security Agent 11 supported features Deep Security Agent 10 supported features Deep Security Agent 9.6 supported features macOS Feature macOS 11.0+ (Big Sur) macOS 12.0+ (Monterey) macOS 13.0.1+ (Ventura) macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma) macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia) Anti-Malware Real-time Feature Set 1 1 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Process Memory Scan, Registry Scan Behavior Monitoring Predictive Machine Learning ✔ 2 ✔ 2 ✔ 2 ✔ 2 ✔ 2 On-demand Feature Set 1 1 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Web Reputation Service ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Activity Monitoring 9 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Firewall ✔ 25 ✔ 25 ✔ 25 ✔ 25 ✔ 25 Intrusion Prevention System Unencrypted Traffic SSL Encrypted Traffic Advanced TLS Traffic Inspection Integrity Monitoring Real-time File Scans Directory Scans Scans of Running Processes, Listening Ports On-demand File and Directory Scans Registry Scans Scans of Running Processes, Listening Ports Log Inspection Application Control Software Rulesets Trust Entities Recommendation Scan Relay Scanner Trend Vision One (XDR) ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Device Control 17 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Footnotes: Feature Set 1 includes signature-based file scanning, spyware scanning, and document exploit protection. Supports only the Quarantine action. Supports continuous real-time scanning. Deep Security Agent for macOS (version 20.0.158+) does not support the Schedule option for real-time scans (Anti-Malware → General → Real-Time Scan). Because embedded operating systems usually run on custom hardware (for example, on point-of-sale terminals), you should thoroughly test your specific hardware platform prior to deployment in a production environment. Trend Micro tests Windows Embedded platforms in a virtualized environment. If you need to raise a case with Trend Micro Support, try to reproduce the problem in a virtualized environment. If the issue cannot be reproduced in a virtualized environment, and is specific to your custom hardware, Trend Micro Support might require you to provide remote access to it for diagnostics. Note Windows 10 IoT was formerly named Windows 10 Embedded, and is therefore considered a Windows Embedded platform. Requires a Full/Desktop Experience installation. Server Core is not supported. Anti-Malware on-demand scans are supported on all Solaris file systems. Supports enhanced real-time integrity monitoring, which uses the application control driver to get information about who changed a monitored file.
