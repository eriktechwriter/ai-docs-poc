/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Policy Define Container Security policies to ensure protection and vulnerability detection for your containers during deployment and run time. Container Security allows you to define cluster-wide policy rules and more granular, prioritized namespace rules to ensure that you can configure optimal protection to all of your Kubernetes containers during deployment and run time. Create and assign rulesets to both your Kubernetes and Amazon ECS clusters to ensure run time protection for all your containers. The following table outlines the available policy actions. Options Description Create a policy Create a new policy (New) or copy the rules from an existing policy (Duplicate) as the basis for a new policy Managing Kubernetes protection policies Managing Amazon ECS policies Modify a policy Select any existing policy in the list to modify the policy settings Managing Kubernetes protection policies Managing Amazon ECS policies Delete a policy Hover over the unneeded policy in the list and click the trash can icon that appears next to the policy name Important You cannot delete active policies. You must remove the policy from all clusters before you can delete it from the list.
