You can view the overall status of the plan and the configuration on the **Deployment Information** tab. You can view the status of the plan execution on target appliances on the **Appliance Execution Status** tab.

- In progress: The plan is currently deploying or the target appliances are executing the plan.

- Pending: The plan is scheduled to deploy, but has not started.

- Completed: The plan deployed successfully.

- Unsuccessful: The plan failed or was canceled. The plan status shows unsuccessful if the plan failed to deploy or at least one appliance failed to execute the plan.
