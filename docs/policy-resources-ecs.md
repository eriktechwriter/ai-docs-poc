/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Centralized policy resource management in Email and Collaboration Security August 19, 2025—Email and Collaboration Security now offers a centralized location for managing policy-related resources and performing email security operations across supported solutions. The first available feature is the approved and blocked lists, enabling administrators to define trusted or suspicious senders and content once and apply them consistently across supported solutions, including Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection and Cloud Email Gateway Protection. This reduces duplicated setup effort and ensures uniform enforcement. For solution-specific control, configurations can still be made individually. In this release, only sender addresses are supported for the approved list, with more object types and common lists coming soon under Policy Resources.
