 Web Reputation Web reputation technology tracks the credibility of web domains by assigning a reputation score based on factors such as a website's age, historical location changes, and indications of suspicious activities discovered through malware behavior analysis. It will then continue to scan sites and block users from accessing infected ones. Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents send queries to smart protection sources to determine the reputation of websites that users are attempting to access. A website’s reputation is correlated with the specific web reputation policy enforced on the endpoint. Depending on the policy in use, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents will either block or allow access to the website. Note This feature supports the latest Safari™, Mozilla™ Firefox™, and Google Chrome™ browsers.
