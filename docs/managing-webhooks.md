Manage webhooks to receive notifications from Trend Vision One.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration â†’ Notifications**, and then click **Webhook List**.

2.  Create or edit a webhook connection.

    - To create a new webhook connection:

      1.  Click **Connect**.

      2.  In the **Webhook Connection** panel, configure the following settings:

          - **Webhook name**: Type a unique name for this connection.

          - **URL**: Type the webhook URL.

          - **Verify webhook server certificate**: Enable to verify webhook server SSL certificate.

            :::danger[Warning]
            Disabling **Verify webhook server certificate** accepts any server certificate and makes communication vulnerable to machine-in-the-middle attacks.

            Trend Micro recommends keeping **Verify webhook server certificate** enabled at all times.
