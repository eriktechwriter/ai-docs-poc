Provision and activate your Trend Vision One console with your existing or new licenses.

You can provision a Trend Vision One console for no additional charge if you hold a valid license for a supported product, a Trend Vision One app, the XDR add-on, or Trend Vision One credits.

:::warning[Important]
The Trend Vision One console supports the following desktop browsers (not officially supported on Android/iOS devices):

- Google Chrome (the newest and the most recent version)

- Mozilla Firefox (the newest and the most recent version)

- Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) (the newest and the most recent version)
:::

There are two access tiers available:

- [Essential Access](essential-access.md): Trend Micro provisions a Trend Vision One console with Essential Access apps and features to customers with licenses for supported on-premises and SaaS products.

- [Advanced Access](advanced-access.md): Trend Micro provisions a Trend Vision One console with a complete suite of apps to customers with Trend Vision One credits or a supported Advanced Access license, such as the Trend Vision One XDR add-on or Zero Trust Secure Access.

The expiration date of the Trend Vision One console aligns with the expiration date of the supported license that expires last. After expiration, there is a 30-day lock period during which you are not able to access the Trend Vision One console through browser or API. All data is deleted after the lock period. Renew your license or credits before the end of the lock period to retain your data.

:::note
If your credits for [Advanced Access](advanced-access.md) expire and you still hold a valid license for [Essential Access](essential-access.md), you can continue using Essential Access apps and features until the associated license expires.
