<td><p>IdP-Only SAML Group Account</p></td>
<td><p>Allows you to add multiple users in an assigned group to sign in to the Trend Vision One console using your corporate identity provider (IdP) solution.</p>
<p>An IdP-Only SAML Group Account is a specialized group account utilized in Trend Vision One that only requires your configured IdP to share the SAML group attribution with Trend Vision One, which only allows users assigned with the group attribution to access the Trend Vision One platform based on the configured group's role settings.</p>
<p>Because the IdP-Only SAML Group Account does not require sharing or synchronizing other data related to the configured user list, Trend Vision One might not have access to individual user information, and cannot send email notifications to users within the IdP-Only SAML Group Account.</p>
