/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Web Reputation Web reputation technology tracks the credibility of web domains by assigning a reputation score based on factors such as a website's age, historical location changes, and indications of suspicious activities discovered through malware behavior analysis. Trend Micro continually analyzes websites and updates web reputation scores to prevent users from accessing potentially malicious content. When a user attempts to access a website, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent queries a smart protection source to ascertain the risk level of the content. The configured Web Reputation policy for the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent determines whether to allow access to the website. Web Reputation allows you to add websites that you consider safe or dangerous to Approved or Blocked lists. The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent does not query web reputation scores for websites added to the lists but instead, automatically allows or blocks access. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
