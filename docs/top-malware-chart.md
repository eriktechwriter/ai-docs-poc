 Top malware detected by pattern-based scanning chart The Top Malware Detected by Pattern-based Scanning chart on the Top Statistics tab of Dashboard displays the email addresses that sent or received the most messages containing malware threats based on the selected mail traffic direction, as detected by traditional pattern-based scanning. Hover over a bar to see details. Select a time period by Date, Week, or Month to show data for the selected time period. The specified time period only affects the data shown on this chart and its corresponding thumbnail chart on the Threats tab. Changing these selections does not affect other charts. Use the Top violators drop-down list to select the number of email addresses that display on the chart. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
