Trend Vision One collects and correlates data across email, endpoint, servers, cloud workloads, and networks, enabling visibility and analysis that is difficult or impossible to achieve otherwise.

Trend Vision One applies the most effective AI and expert analytics to the activity data collected from native sensors in the environment to produce fewer, higher-fidelity alerts. Global threat intelligence from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network™ combined with expert detection rules continually updated from our threat experts maximize the power of AI and analytical models in unparalleled ways.

With more context, events that seem benign on their own suddenly become meaningful indicators of compromise, and you can quickly contain the impact, minimizing the severity and scope.

Trend Vision One is a single platform that gives you:

- Prioritized alerts based on one expert alert schema to interpret data in a standard and meaningful way

- A consolidated view to uncover events and the attack path across security layers

- Guided investigations to understand the impact and identify the path to resolution
