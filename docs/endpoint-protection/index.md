# Endpoint Protection

Trend Vision One Endpoint Security provides comprehensive, multi-layered protection for your endpoints. This section covers all protection modules and their configuration options.

## Protection Modules Overview

Our endpoint protection combines multiple security technologies to provide defense-in-depth against modern threats:

### Core Protection Technologies

- **[Anti-Malware](./anti-malware/)** - Real-time, scheduled, and on-demand malware protection
- **[Firewall](./firewall/)** - Network-based intrusion prevention and access control
- **[Intrusion Prevention](./intrusion-prevention/)** - Advanced threat detection and blocking
- **[Application Control](./application-control/)** - Whitelist/blacklist application management

## How Endpoint Protection Works

### Layered Security Approach
1. **Prevention** - Block known threats before they execute
2. **Detection** - Identify suspicious behavior and unknown threats  
3. **Response** - Automatically remediate detected threats
4. **Recovery** - Restore systems to clean state when needed

### Real-Time Protection
- Continuous monitoring of system activity
- Behavioral analysis of running processes
- Network traffic inspection and filtering
- File system access control and monitoring

## Protection Features

### Advanced Threat Detection
- **Machine Learning** - AI-powered threat identification
- **Behavioral Analysis** - Detect zero-day and advanced persistent threats
- **Reputation Services** - Cloud-based threat intelligence
- **Sandbox Analysis** - Safe execution environment for suspicious files

### Automated Response
- **Quarantine** - Isolate infected files automatically
- **Process Termination** - Stop malicious processes immediately
- **Network Isolation** - Disconnect compromised endpoints
- **Rollback** - Undo malicious changes to system

## Configuration Best Practices

### Initial Setup
1. **Start with Default Policies** - Use recommended baseline configurations
2. **Test in Pilot Group** - Validate settings with small user group
3. **Monitor and Tune** - Adjust based on false positives and performance
4. **Gradual Rollout** - Deploy to organization in phases

### Ongoing Management
- **Regular Policy Reviews** - Update configurations quarterly
- **Exception Management** - Maintain approved exclusion lists
- **Performance Monitoring** - Ensure protection doesn't impact productivity
- **Threat Intelligence Updates** - Keep protection signatures current

## Quick Configuration Guide

### Essential Protection Settings
1. **Enable Real-Time Scanning** - Provides continuous protection
2. **Configure Scheduled Scans** - Regular full system scans
3. **Set Up Firewall Rules** - Control network access
4. **Define Application Policies** - Manage software execution

### Performance Optimization
- **Scan Exclusions** - Exclude trusted files and folders
- **Resource Limits** - Control CPU and memory usage
- **Scan Scheduling** - Run intensive scans during off-hours
- **Cache Settings** - Optimize for frequently accessed files

## Monitoring Protection Status

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Detection Rates** - Number of threats blocked
- **False Positive Rates** - Legitimate files incorrectly flagged
- **System Performance** - Impact on endpoint performance
- **Policy Compliance** - Endpoints following security policies

### Regular Health Checks
- Review protection module status
- Analyze threat detection reports
- Monitor system resource usage
- Validate policy deployment success

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Anti-Malware** - Set up your primary threat protection
2. **Enable Firewall** - Control network communications
3. **Set Up Intrusion Prevention** - Add advanced threat detection
4. **Implement Application Control** - Manage software execution
