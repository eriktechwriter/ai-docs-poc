/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Policy Management Policy management allows administrators to enforce product settings on managed products and endpoints from a single management console. Administrators create a policy by selecting the targets and configuring a list of product settings. To perform policy management on a new managed product or endpoint, move the managed product from the New Entity folder to another folder in the Product Directory structure.
