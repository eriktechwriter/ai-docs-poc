/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Scan for compressed executable files (real-time scan only) Viruses often use real-time compression algorithms to attempt to circumvent virus filtering. The IntelliTrap feature blocks real-time compressed executable files and pairing them with other malware characteristics. Important Because IntelliTrap identifies such files as security risks and may incorrectly block safe files, consider quarantining (not deleting or cleaning) files when you enable IntelliTrap. (See Customize malware remedial actions.) If users regularly exchange real-time compressed executable files, disable IntelliTrap. IntelliTrap uses the virus scan engine, IntelliTrap Pattern, and IntelliTrap Exception Pattern. For macOS agents, IntelliTrap is not supported. Procedure Open the properties of the malware scan configuration. On the General tab, select Enable IntelliTrap. Click OK. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
