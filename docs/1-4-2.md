 1.4.2 - Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Do not bind the scheduler service to non-loopback insecure addresses. The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface. Note By default, the --bind-address parameter is set to 0.0.0.0. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation Edit the Scheduler pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the --bind-address parameter.
