 Create a policy Create a policy and configure the basic settings. Important Policies is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-Release Disclaimer before using the feature. This feature is not available in all regions. Configure your policy resources before creating a policy. Create a policy and configure the basic settings to use with assignments to manage your endpoint settings. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Endpoint Security Policies → Policies. Click Create policy. The Create policy window appears. Specify the Policy name. Trend Micro recommends using a name that is easy to search and identify the purpose of the policy. Configure the initial settings for the security modules. When creating the policy, the default settings are automatically selected. Enabling a security module applies the recommended settings. Note Some features require allocating credits when you assign an policy to your endpoints. Click Create. The policy is created and saved, and the Policy Settings window appears. Configure the security modules. Important Navigating between the security modules or leaving the Policy Settings screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click Save before leaving the current screen. Click Save to save and continue editing. Click Save and exit to save your settings and exit to Policies. Click Discard and exit to reject your changes and exit to Policies. This does not delete a newly created policy. For more information, see Edit a policy and security modules. When you have finished configuring the security modules, click Save and exit. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
