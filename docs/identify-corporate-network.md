/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Identifying corporate network locations Define your corporate networks on the Internet Access Cloud Gateway or through Internet Access On-Premises Gateways to identify your internal users and apply more granular Secure Access Rules. The Internet Access Cloud and On-Premises Gateways use your corporate network locations to help identify your internal users' internet traffic. You can use these locations to create specific HTTPS inspection and Secure Access Rules for branch offices or departments, and define rule enforcement schedules based on time zones specified for these locations. Procedure On the Trend Vision One console, go to Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration. On the Gateways tab, choose to specify and register your corporate network locations to the Internet Access Cloud Gateway, or deploy an Internet Access On-Premises Gateway.
