These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Note By default, the etcd service can be queried by unauthenticated clients. Impact All clients attempting to access the etcd server will require a valid client certificate. Audit Run the following command on the etcd server node: ps -ef | grep etcd Verify that the --client-cert-auth argument is set to true. Remediation Edit the etcd pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml on the master node and set the below parameter. --client-cert-auth="true" Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
