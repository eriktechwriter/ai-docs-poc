For more information, see Investigate an alert and Workbench insights alerts in the Workbench documentation. Furthermore, the Automated Response Playbook now includes an additional automated response action: "Terminate processes". This enhancement enables users to automatically terminate any "unrated" target processes running on an endpoint. For more information, see Create Automated Response Playbooks.
