 Manage tagged assets Add or remove tagged assets associated with a given tag. Procedure Choose a tag property and click the icon to expand the list of associated tag values. After choosing a tag value, click the number of Tagged assets for a given asset type, or click Manage assets. The Manage tagged assets window appears. Note If no assets appear in the window, you can use the Asset type filter to show any applicable assets. Assign the tag to assets. Click + Assign to assets. The Assign tag to assets window appears. Select one or more assets from the list and click Assign tag. Click Assign in the confirmation window. Note For some platform tag properties, you can only assign one tag value to a given asset. For those tags, if another value of the same tag property is already assigned to one or more of the selected assets, click Replace in the confirmation window instead. By taking this action, you assign the new tag value to the selected assets. This action removes any other values of the same tag property from the assets. You can also remove the tag from existing tagged assets. In the Managed tagged assets window, select one or more tagged assets. Click Remove tag. In the confirmation window, click Remove. Note If you remove a tag from an asset with no other tags, the asset is reset to system-defined tag values. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
