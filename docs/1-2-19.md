/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 1.2.19 - Ensure that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Rotate log files on reaching 100 MB or as appropriate. Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Note By default, auditing is not enabled. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver Verify that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate. Remediation Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml on the Control Plane node and set the --audit-log-maxsize parameter to an appropriate size in MB. For example, to set it as 100 MB: --audit-log-maxsize=100 Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
