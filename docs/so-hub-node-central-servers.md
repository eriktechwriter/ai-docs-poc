/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Suspicious Object Hub and Node Apex Central Servers Trend Micro Apex Central™ Suspicious Object Hub and Node architecture allows you to synchronize suspicious object lists across multiple Apex Central servers. The suspicious object lists on the Hub Apex Central server consolidate the suspicious object lists from all Node Apex Central servers, and any other managed products registered to any of these servers, and then deploys the lists back to the Node Apex Central servers. Administrators must first configure a Suspicious Object Hub Apex Central server and, depending on the environment, assign other Apex Central servers to act as Suspicious Object Node servers. Trend Micro Deep Discovery products can register to the Suspicious Object Hub or any Suspicious Object Node Apex Central server. This architecture requires that you configure all suspicious object actions through the Suspicious Object Hub Apex Central server console. Important You must perform all operations on the suspicious object lists through the Suspicious Object Hub Apex Central to ensure that all Node Apex Central servers remain properly synchronized. Scan actions performed on suspicious objects though a Suspicious Object Node Apex Central may not synchronize to all connected servers. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
