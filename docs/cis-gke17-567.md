 5.6.7 - Ensure use of Google-managed SSL Certificates (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 2 Encrypt traffic to HTTPS load balancers using Google-managed SSL certificates. Encrypting traffic between users and the Kubernetes workload is fundamental to protecting data sent over the web. Google-managed SSL Certificates are provisioned, renewed, and managed for domain names. This is only available for HTTPS load balancers created using Ingress Resources, and not TCP/UDP load balancers created using service of type:LoadBalancer. Note By default, Google-managed SSL Certificates are not created when an Ingress resource is defined. Impact Google-managed SSL Certificates are less flexible than certificates that are self obtained and managed. Managed certificates support a single, non-wildcard domain. Self-managed certificates can support wildcards and multiple subject alternative names (SANs). Audit Using Command Line: Identify if there are any workloads exposed publicly using services of type:LoadBalancer: kubectl get svc -A -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.type=="LoadBalancer")' Consider using ingresses instead of these services in order to use Google managed SSL certificates. For the ingresses within the cluster, run the following command: kubectl get ingress -A -o json | jq .items[] | jq '{name: .metadata.name, annotations: .metadata.annotations, namespace: .metadata.namespace, status: .status}' The above command should return the name of the ingress, namespace, annotations and status. Check that the following annotation is present to ensure managed certificates are referenced. "annotations": { ... "networking.gke.io/managed-certificates": "<example_certificate>" }, For completeness, run the following command to ensure that the managed certificate resource exists: kubectl get managedcertificates -A The above command returns a list of managed certificates for which <example_certificate> should exist within the same namespace as the ingress. Remediation If services of type:LoadBalancer are discovered, consider replacing the service with an Ingress. To configure the Ingress and use Google-managed SSL certificates, follow these instructions. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
