Procedure Log on to the Suspicious Object Node Apex Central server console. Go to Threat Intel → Distribution Settings. The Distribution Settings screen appears. In the Hub Apex Central Settings section, click Unregister. A confirmation dialog appears with a message indicating that the server is properly unregistered from the Hub Apex Central.
