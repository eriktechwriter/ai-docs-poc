 Customized Expressions Create customized expressions if none of the predefined expressions meet the company's requirements. Expressions are a powerful string-matching tool. Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions. Poorly written expressions can dramatically impact performance. When creating expressions: Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions. For example, when creating an expression that includes a date, refer to the expressions prefixed with "Date".
