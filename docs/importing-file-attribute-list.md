 Importing a File Attribute List Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the file attribute lists. You can generate the file by exporting the file attribute lists from either the server you are currently accessing or from another server. Procedure Go to Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Data Identifiers. Click the File Attribute tab. Click Import and then locate the .dat file containing the file attribute lists. Click Open. A message appears, informing you if the import was successful. If a file attribute list to be imported already exists, it will be skipped. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
