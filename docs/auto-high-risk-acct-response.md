/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Automated High-Risk Account Response playbooks now available in public preview August 26, 2024—Security Playbooks has introduced a new playbook template: Automated High-Risk Account Response. This playbook enables users to manage accounts with high risk scores by taking specified response actions. In addition to the standard user account actions, the playbook has expanded its functionality to add these accounts to a dedicate restricted user group within Zscaler. This integration allows for specific Zscaler policies to be applied directly to the group. To utilize this feature, users must configure one or both Zscaler integrations within the Third-Party Integration app. For more information, see Create Automated High-Risk Account Response playbooks.
