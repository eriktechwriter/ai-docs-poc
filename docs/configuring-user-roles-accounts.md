---

With Trend Vision One you can configure user roles to grant app permissions and scope to user accounts. You can then create user accounts, like local accounts or SAML, single sign-on (SSO) accounts, for authorized users to access the Trend Vision One console and assign the user roles these accounts.

Configure user roles to grant app permissions to Trend Vision One user accounts. From the User Roles page, you can view the predefined roles that include built in permissions or create custom roles with specified permissions and scope.

Create and manage Trend Vision One user accounts to allow authorized users to access the console.
