 Most critical failures The Most critical failures section displays the top 15 failed Checks sorted by risk level against All account, Individual accounts, or Groups, and can be viewed either by rule or by resource. We recommend that you take corrective actions on the most critical failures first as these failures potentially expose your organization to high-level security vulnerabilities, cost inefficiencies, performance, reliability, or other issues.
