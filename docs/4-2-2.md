/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 4.2.2 - Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Worker Node Do not allow all requests. Enable explicit authorization. Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests. Note By default, --authorization-mode argument is set to AlwaysAllow. Impact Unauthorized requests will be denied. Audit Run the following command on each node: ps -ef | grep kubelet If the --authorization-mode argument is present check that it is not set to AlwaysAllow. If it is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by --config, and that file sets authorization: mode to something other than AlwaysAllow. It is also possible to review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the /configz endpoint on the Kubelet API port (typically 10250/TCP). Accessing these with appropriate credentials will provide details of the Kubelet's configuration. Remediation If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set authorization: mode to Webhook. If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf on each worker node and set the below parameter in KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS variable. --authorization-mode=Webhook Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example: systemctl daemon-reload systemctl restart kubelet.service Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
