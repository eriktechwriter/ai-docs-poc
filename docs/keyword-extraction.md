Select Contain Type to indicate the condition for the criterion. Specify a keyword to scan in the Keywords text box, and click Add. The keyword appears in the blank area. Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection scans files for the specified keyword and triggers a keyword extraction rule when the content matches the keyword, including content with the following separators to the left or right of the content: "\t", "\n", "\r", ",", ".", and spaces. Take keyword Internal Use Only as an example.
