/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Getting started with Workbench Connect Trend Micro and third-party data sources to Trend Vision One to enable Agentic SIEM & XDR capabilities in Workbench. Procedure Connect data sources to Trend Vision One. Go to Agentic SIEM & XDR → Data Source and Log Management → Data sources and retention → All Agentic SIEM & XDR data sources. Note The All Agentic SIEM & XDR data sources tab displays all data sources that supply data to Agentic SIEM & XDR in Trend Vision One along with connection status, data target, and analytic retention period. Click the name of the data source you want to connect.The Data Source window appears. Follow the configuration guide steps to connect the specified data source. To collect and organize log data from third-party data sources, configure third-party log collection. Note Third-Party Log Collection is a log management system that allows you to collect and organize log data from the third-party data sources on your organization's network. The collected data is then available for analytic or compliance purposes throughout Trend Vision One. You may set specific ingestion and retention policies on a particular log repository to more efficiently organize collected log data and quickly access the data when needed. Ingested data is available for use in XDR Data Explorer, Workbench, Detection Model Management, and Observed Attack Techniques. Enable WebGL in your web browser.
