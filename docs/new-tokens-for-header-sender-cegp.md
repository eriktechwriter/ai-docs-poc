 New tokens in notifications and stamps for header sender information July 21, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection includes a new token, %HEADER_SENDER%, which administrators can use in email notifications for policy matches and in message body stamps. This token retrieves the sender address from the message header—rather than the envelope—providing a more accurate representation of the sender in certain scenarios. It serves as an alternative to the existing %SENDER% token. Email and Collaboration Security → Cloud Email Gateway Protection © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
