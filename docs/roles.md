 Role View information on the available roles in your organization along with assigned users to help better understand your organization's security posture. The Role tab allows you to view the roles assigned to users, groups, or devices in your organization. Roles may be privileged or regular. Trend Micro recommends limiting active privileged roles in your organization to the fewest number of necessary roles. Important Only roles currently held by a user, group, or device are displayed. The following table details the columns on the Role tab. Column name Description Role name Name of a role in Microsoft Entra ID. Description Description for a role. Assigned users Users assigned to a role. Click the number to see a list of assigned users. Permissions Permissions assigned to a role. Click the number to see a list of assigned permissions.

Privileged roles can be used to delegate directory resource management to other users, modify credentials, modify authentication or authorization policies, or access restricted data.
