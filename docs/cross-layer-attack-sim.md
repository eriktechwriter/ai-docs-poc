/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Running the cross-layer attack simulation Run a cross-layer attack simulation in Trend Vision One to simulate attacks targeting multiple security layers across your environment. The cross-layer attack simulation requires that you prepare one deployed Virtual Network Sensor or connected Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, and two Windows endpoints with Endpoint Sensor enabled. Procedure On the Trend Vision One console, click the Resource Center icon (). Click Simulations. Click Cross-layer attack simulation. The Cross-layer attack simulation window appears. Click Download demo script to download the demo script. Run the script on one of the Windows endpoints. Note Ensure that you specify the IP address of both endpoints while running the script. On the Cross-layer attack simulation screen, click Download demo script in the Endpoint section to download the second demo script. On a Windows endpoint with Endpoint Sensor enabled, run the second demo script. Go to Agentic SIEM & XDR → Workbench or Agentic SIEM & XDR → Observed Attack Techniques to view the results. Note Results might take a few minutes to appear. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
