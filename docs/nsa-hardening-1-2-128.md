Note By default, Node authorization is not enabled. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver Verify that the --authorization-mode argument exists and is set to a value to include Node. Remediation Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml on the Control Plane node and set the --authorization-mode parameter to a value that includes Node. --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
