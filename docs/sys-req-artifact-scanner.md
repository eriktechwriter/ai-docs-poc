/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ System requirements The following minimum system requirements are sufficient to scan most artifacts. Your system must have enough storage capacity to accommodate the size of your target artifact. For images, your system must have sufficient space for its uncompressed size. Memory consumption of the Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) CLI scales with the number of files an artifact contains. Some artifacts may require additional memory to complete successfully. Performance can be improved by increasing memory resources and CPU cores.
