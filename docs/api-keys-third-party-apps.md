API keys allow third-party applications to access your Trend Vision One environment through authorized accounts.

To ensure that only authorized applications can gain access to your Trend Vision One data, you must create a user account specifically configured to allow API usage.

For a reference of the APIs available for Trend Vision One, see <https://automation.trendmicro.com/xdr/home>.

:::warning[Important]
- You must access the Trend Vision One console using an account with the *Master Administrator* role. If you require a new authentication token but do not have the necessary permissions to access the console, contact your administrator.

- The user role requires the necessary permissions to connect specific APIs. For a list of the necessary permissions, see <https://automation.trendmicro.com/xdr/Guides/Authentication>.
