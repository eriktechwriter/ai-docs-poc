/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Security Playbooks supports management scope July 3, 2023—For customers that signed up for or expressly updated Trend Vision One on or after July 3, 2023, Security Playbooks now supports management scope. Permissions to view or manage playbooks can be assigned based on management scope for custom roles. Users can only approve the execution of playbooks and view execution results for endpoints in their management scope. Newly created playbooks are executed based on the playbook creator's management scope. All roles retain full permissions for playbooks created before the implementation of management scope.
