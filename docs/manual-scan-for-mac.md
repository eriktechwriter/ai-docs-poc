 Manual Scan Manual Scan is an on-demand scan and starts immediately after a user runs the scan on the agent console. The time it takes to complete scanning depends on the number of files to scan and the endpoint's hardware resources. Configure and apply Manual Scan settings to one or several Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents and groups, or to all Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents that the server manages.
