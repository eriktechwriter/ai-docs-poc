 Asset Coverage The Asset Coverage widget offers a detailed overview of your cloud accounts, categorized by cloud provider. It also indicates the number of accounts with Trend Vision One capabilities enabled, including Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection and Real-Time Posture Monitoring. This widget helps you ensure comprehensive security coverage across your cloud environment, allowing you to easily identify and address any gaps. From the Asset Coverage widget, you can: Click Manage cloud accounts to open the Cloud Accounts page, where you can add cloud accounts, view existing accounts, and enable features on cloud accounts. In the Cloud provider table, click a cloud provider name to view a list of accounts associated with that provider on the Cloud Accounts page. In the Capability table, click a Trend Vision One feature to see a list of cloud accounts using that feature on the Cloud Accounts page and assess whether you need to enable that feature on other cloud accounts.
