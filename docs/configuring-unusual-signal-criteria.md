Note Trend Micro recommends that you use the "Do not intercept messages" and "Insert stamp in body" actions for unusual signal detection. A default stamp "Unusual signal detection" is available for use. Procedure Select Unusual signal. Related information Unusual signals Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
