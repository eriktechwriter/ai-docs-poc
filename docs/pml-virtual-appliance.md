 Predictive Machine Learning in Virtual Appliance When you are adding or modifying a mount point, you can enable Predictive Machine Learning (PML) for that mount point. In File Security Virtual Appliance, when PML detects an unknown or low-prevalence file, the Advanced Threat Scan Engine (ATSE) extracts the file's metadata and sends the report to the PML engine hosted on the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network (SPN). Through use of malware modeling, PML compares the sample to the malware model, assigns a probability score, and determines the probable malware type that the file contains. Note that neither the file nor its contents leave your system, only its metadata is sent. Note Using PML may slow your scanning time. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
