/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Public cloud app reputation Trend Micro experts constantly evaluate, assess, and adjust public cloud application reputation based on multiple criteria to ensure that customers always have the latest information. Note A public cloud application's reputation indicates the level of maturity and security compliance for the application and does not indicate that an application is malicious or dangerous. Public cloud app reputation scores range from good to moderate to poor. A lower reputation score indicates a better overall reputation. Trend Micro determines a public cloud application’s reputation based on: Standards compliance (for example, CSA STAR level, ISO, NIST) Security features (for example, multi-factor authentication, DoS protection) Security headers (for example, x-frame-options, content-security-policy) Security breaches or other events that may indicate a compromised service In addition, Trend Micro evaluates reputation based on regulatory compliance with the following standards and frameworks: 21 CFR (GxP) C5 (Germany) CJIS COBIT CS Gold Mark (Japan) CSA STAR LEVEL 1: Self-Assessment CSA STAR LEVEL 2: Attestation CSA STAR LEVEL 2: Certification CSA STAR LEVEL 3: Continuous Monitoring Cyber Essentials Plus (UK) DoD IL2 DoD IL4 DoD IL5 DoD IL6 EU Model Clauses EU-US/Swiss-US Privacy Shield FERPA FFIEC FINRA FIPS 140-2 FISC (Japan) FISMA FedRAMP GAAP GDPR GLBA HIPAA/HITECH HITRUST ISAE 3402 ISO 20000 ISO 22301 ISO 27001 ISO 27017 ISO 27018 ISO 9001 ITAR MPAA My Number Act (Japan) NEN-7510 (Netherlands) NIST 800-171 NIST 800-53 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) PCI DSS SEC 17a-4 SOC 1 SOC 2 SOC 3 SOX SSAE 16 SSAE 18 Safe Harbor TISAX (EU) TRUSTe UK G-Cloud UK NCSC Cloud Security Principles VPAT / Section 508 WCAG 2.0/ISO 40500 xDTM © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
