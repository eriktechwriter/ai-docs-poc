/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Warning: Activity Monitoring engine has only basic functions When a new Linux kernel version is released, Trend Micro releases a new kernel support package for the agent. If a computer's kernel version is not currently supported, then the Activity Monitoring engine can provide only basic protection. Normal protection resumes when the agent receives the update to support the new kernel version. To prevent this problem, verify that the new kernel version is supported before you upgrade it.
