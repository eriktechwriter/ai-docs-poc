 Runtime Malware Scanning Configuration Settings The Runtime Malware Scanning feature allows you to customize settings based on the cluster's purpose and configuration. The default CPU utilization for the scanner is limited to 100m - 1000m (0.1 - 1 CPU core) with auto-scaling disabled. Recommended settings: For single-node clusters, keep auto-scaling disabled and increase the CPU limit to multi-core to optimize performance. malwareScanner: requests: cpu: 1000m memory: 512Mi limits: cpu: 2000m memory: 1024Mi For multi-node clusters, enabling auto-scaling and increase the number of concurrent jobs to optimize performance. malwareScanning: scanner: autoscaling: enabled: true minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 5 # depends on the number compute nodes in cluster targetCPUUtilization: 800 scanManager: maxJobCount: 5 # concurrent jobs For scanning large compressed files or images, extend the default timeout to ensure all files are scanned. malwareScanning: enabled: true scanTimeoutSeconds: 300 # for single-file scanning within images scanManager: activeDeadlineSeconds: 3600 # for single-image scanning To support daily scanning, enable auto-scaling and increase the concurrent job number. (Based on our testing, scanning a Linux-based image with auto-scaling disabled requires around 5 minutes.) The following example is optimal for scanning 1000 Linux-based images on a daily basis. malwareScanning: scanner: autoscaling: enabled: true minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 4 targetCPUUtilization: 800 scanManager: maxJobCount: 4 # concurrent jobs Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
