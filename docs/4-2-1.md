 4.2.1 - Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Worker Node Disable anonymous requests to the Kubelet server. When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. Note By default, anonymous access is enabled. Impact Anonymous requests will be rejected. Audit If using a Kubelet configuration file, check that there is an entry for authentication: anonymous: enabled set to false. Run the following command on each node: ps -ef | grep kubelet Verify that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false. This executable argument may be omitted, provided there is a corresponding entry set to false in the Kubelet config file. Remediation If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set authentication: anonymous: enabled to false. If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf on each worker node and set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable. --anonymous-auth=false Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example: systemctl daemon-reload systemctl restart kubelet.service Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
