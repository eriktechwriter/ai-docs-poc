 Viewing threat detection data Procedure Go to the Threat Detection tab. Select an organization to view the threat detection and policy enforcement data of this organization or select All organizations to view the aggregated data of all the organizations. Select or deselect a service to show or hide data related to the service. Note If you deselect this check box, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will continue protecting your application or service, but threat detection data for the corresponding application or service will not display on the Threat Detection tab. Click Customize dashboard to select one or several widget sections to display from the drop-down list. In the upper-right corner of a section, set the time period to view the data on all widgets in the section. Click the drop-down menu and select a time period. Optionally select Apply to all widgets. The configured time period will apply to every widget on the Threat Detection tab. Click Apply. You can still go to each widget to set a different time period as necessary. Drill down from the clickable numbers in a widget to related logs. (Optional) Export the data on the Threat Detection tab into a report in PDF format by clicking Export Data.
