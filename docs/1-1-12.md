 1.1.12 - Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd. etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by etcd:etcd. Note By default, etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd. Audit On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument --data-dir, from the below command: ps -ef | grep etcd Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/etcd Verify that the ownership is set to etcd:etcd. Remediation On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument --data-dir, from the below command: ps -ef | grep etcd Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). chown etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
