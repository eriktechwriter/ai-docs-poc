 Accept reported risk events April 8, 2024—In addition to the Dismissed and Remediated statuses, an Accepted status is now available for reported risk events in Threat and Exposure Management. Marking a risk event as Accepted indicates that you acknowledge the risk but are unable to remediate or mitigate it at this time. Risk events marked as Accepted still contribute to your Risk Index. Create accepted risk event rules when marking a risk event as Accepted to mark all current and future instances of the risk event as Accepted within a specified time period.
