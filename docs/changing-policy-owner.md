/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Changing the Policy Owner The default owner of a policy is the user account that created the policy. You can use the Policy Management screen to change the owner of a policy to any Trend Vision One user account. You can also change the policy owner to an Active Directory group, which designates all Active Directory users within the group as owners of the policy. Important If you change the owner of a policy to a user account that does not have access rights to the specified targets, the new owner can modify the policy settings but cannot view the policy data. Procedure Go to Policies → Policy Management. The Policy Management screen appears. Select one or more policies to change the owner. Click Change Owner.The Change Policy Owner screen appears. Select a user account from the drop-down list. Click Save to change the owner. Trend Vision One sends an email notification to all user accounts assigned the Administrator role. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
