/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Risk assessment Threat and Exposure Management identifies at-risk assets, and provides remediation and suggested preventative options to manage the risk to your environment. The Risk Assessment tab of the Device, Account, Service Account, and Cloud Asset profile screens displays the Risk Indicators table, which provides details about the risk events affecting your assets. By mitigating the effects of the risk events and taking measures to prevent repeat events, you can lower your company's overall Cyber Risk Index. Expand each row to view remediation actions to manage each event as well as available attack prevention/detection rules you can apply to mitigate the event. After performing remediation actions, create a Zero Trust Secure Access rule to automatically respond to similar attacks in the future. For more information, see Secure access rules. The following table outlines remediation actions for common risk factors.
