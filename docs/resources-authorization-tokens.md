 Authorization tokens Create authorization tokens to allow end users to terminate the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent. Authorization tokens are a policy resource used for enabling endpoint users to terminate the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent. To use the authorization token, you must enable the Agent Interface and select Allow users to shut down the agent using an authorization token. For more information, see Agent Interface. Authorization tokens do not have a limit on number of users or uses as long as the token is valid. You can have up to 10 authorization tokens. Note Trend Vision One does not automatically delete expired authorization tokens. Use the delete action to remove expired tokens.
