# Policy Deployment

Deploy security policies to endpoints and manage policy distribution.

## Overview

Policy deployment ensures that your security configurations reach all target endpoints effectively. This section covers deployment strategies, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## Deployment Methods

### Automatic Deployment
- **Real-time Push** - Immediate policy distribution
- **Scheduled Deployment** - Deploy during maintenance windows
- **Group-based Deployment** - Target specific endpoint groups

### Manual Deployment
- **On-demand Deployment** - Deploy policies as needed
- **Selective Deployment** - Choose specific endpoints
- **Test Deployment** - Deploy to pilot groups first

## Deployment Process

1. **Prepare Policy** - Validate policy configuration
2. **Select Targets** - Choose endpoints or groups
3. **Schedule Deployment** - Set deployment timing
4. **Monitor Progress** - Track deployment status
5. **Verify Success** - Confirm policy application

## Monitoring Deployment

- **Deployment Status** - Track policy distribution progress
- **Compliance Reporting** - Monitor policy adherence
- **Error Handling** - Address deployment failures
- **Rollback Procedures** - Revert problematic deployments
