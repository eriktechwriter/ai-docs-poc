# Policy Inheritance

Understand how policies inherit settings and manage hierarchical policy structures.

## Overview

Policy inheritance allows you to create efficient policy hierarchies where child policies inherit settings from parent policies, reducing configuration overhead and ensuring consistency.

## How Inheritance Works

- **Parent Policies** - Define baseline security settings
- **Child Policies** - Inherit and can override parent settings
- **Policy Hierarchy** - Multiple levels of inheritance supported
- **Override Rules** - Child settings take precedence over parent settings

## Managing Policy Inheritance

### Creating Policy Hierarchies
1. Create parent policy with baseline settings
2. Create child policies that inherit from parent
3. Override specific settings in child policies as needed
4. Test inheritance behavior

### Best Practices
- Keep parent policies simple and stable
- Use inheritance for common settings
- Document inheritance relationships
- Test changes carefully
