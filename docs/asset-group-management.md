Create asset groups and define the structure of your organization.

The **Asset Group Management** app allows you to create asset groups and designate corresponding tag values of the Asset group tag, which enables you to assign tags to your assets.

:::note
You can create a maximum of 30 asset groups in up to two layers under your organization. The organization node does not count towards the maximum.
:::

By organizing your assets into groups, you can take advantage of the following benefits:

- Visualize the overall structure of your organization

- Streamline your workflow by managing assets in groups, rather than individually

The following table outlines the actions available in the **Asset Group Management** screen.
