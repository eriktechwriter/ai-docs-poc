# 1.1.6 - Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kube-scheduler service in the master node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, `kube-scheduler.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
