# Configuring Packet Capture

Enable and configure packet capture rules.

:::warning[Important]

The packet capture feature in **Network Security** only supports Deep Discovery Inspector version 6.7 or later.

Packet capture increases processor and disk space usage on enabled appliances.

Enabling packet capture requires the appliance to restart. Disabling packet capture does not require a restart.
