<td><p>How do I redirect my mail exchanger record (MX record)?</p></td>
<td><p>Before redirecting your MX record to the service, make sure you have added and configured your domain to your Cloud Email Gateway Protection.</p>
<p>To redirect your MX record:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For details about adding an MX record for the Cloud Email Gateway Protection server, see step 1 in <a href="trend-vision-one-configuring-domain">Configuring a domain</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Check Cloud Email Gateway Protection welcome email message, which contains the specific MX record information.</p></li>
<li><p>Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Manual configuration</p>
<p>If you manage your own DNS, you can manually edit your MX record (this applies to self-managed, smaller accounts).</p></li>
<li><p>Through a support technician</p>
<p>If you are unsure how to configure the MX records for your domain, contact your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) help desk or your Domain Name Service (DNS) technician for assistance. If your DNS is managed by a third-party or ISP, either they can do this for you or they may have a simple Web interface allowing you to make the change yourself. It can take up to 48 hours for any changes to propagate throughout the system.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>After making the modifications to the MX record, Cloud Email Gateway Protection becomes the point of entry of messages for your domain. After the DNS record modifications take effect (up to 48 hours), all inbound email traffic is routed through Cloud Email Gateway Protection.</p>


:::tip

<p>After the modifications take effect, test the message route by sending messages from another email service provider (for example, Yahoo! Mail or Gmail) to a recipient in your domain. If you receive the message from that email service provider, the MX record is configured correctly.</p>

<li><p>Configure your MTA to accept transactions from these IP addresses</p></li>

<tr>
<td><p>Does Cloud Email Gateway Protection store or archive email messages?</p></td>
<td><p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection does not store or archive email messages by default. All messages are processed and immediately passed through to the customer's MTA. Messages are not spooled or stored in memory unless your MTA becomes unavailable. However, if you create a policy to quarantine messages (spam for example) these email messages will be stored at our data center for up to 30 days.</p>
<p>With Email Continuity enabled by default, Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides a standby email system that gives virtually uninterrupted use of email in the event of a mail server outage. If an outage occurs, Cloud Email Gateway Protection will keep your incoming email messages for 10 days. Once your email server is back online within the 10-day period, these messages will be restored to your email server.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>How do I reset or resend an End User Console password?</p></td>
<td><p>When your users lost or cannot remember their password, they can go to the logon screen of the Cloud Email Gateway Protection End User Console and click <strong>Forgot your password</strong> to reset their passwords.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to reset end users' passwords.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>What does the service do when my MTA is unavailable?</p></td>
<td><p>If your MTA becomes unavailable for whatever reason, your message stream is automatically queued for up to ten (10) days or until such time that your server comes back online.</p>
<p>You should not lose any of your valuable email messages due to hardware or software failure, power outages, network failure or simple human error.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Where does outgoing mail go?</p></td>
<td><p>By default, your outbound email messages are handled directly by your own MTA and passed out to other networks as it is currently handled. However, with Cloud Email Gateway Protection (full version) you can choose to redirect your outbound email traffic through Cloud Email Gateway Protection services.</p>
<p>Opting for Outbound Filtering:</p>
<p>When you activate Cloud Email Gateway Protection, you will be informed of what MTA to send your outbound messages to if you choose to utilize outbound filtering.</p>
<p>For complete instructions on enabling outbound filtering, see <a href="trend-vision-one-configuring-domain">Configuring a domain</a>.</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>How does Cloud Email Gateway Protection implement the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol?</p></td>
<td><p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection is configured in Opportunistic Transport Layer Security (TLS) mode. In this mode, the MTA servers will initially check if the sending or receiving MTA can perform SMTP transaction in TLS mode. If so, the entire session and process will be done in TLS mode.</p></td>
