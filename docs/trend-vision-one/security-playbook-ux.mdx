# Security Playbooks feature enhancements and user experience improvement

January 24, 2024—The Endpoint Response Actions playbooks and Incident Response Evidence Collection playbooks have been enhanced to support a broader range of IP formats for the playbook target. In addition to using a wildcard, you have the flexibility to use CIDR notation or specify an IP range from a starting IP address to an ending IP address.

Additionally, the email notification content for user-defined Automated Response Playbooks has been improved to enhance the user experience.
