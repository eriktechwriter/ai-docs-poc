# Application Control Criteria

Configure Application Control criteria that you can then assign to Security Agent policy rules. You can create "Allow" and "Block" criteria to limit the applications that users can execute or install on protected endpoints. You can also create assessment criteria to monitor the applications executing on endpoints and then refine the criteria based on the usage results.

:::warning[Important]

You must configure Application Control criteria before deploying an Application Control policy to Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents.

Each managed product provides different policy settings that you can configure and deploy to policy targets. You can find a complete list of supported managed products and the policy settings for each in the Apex Central as a Service Widget and Policy Management Guide.

You can download a PDF version of the guide, or view the guide online, using the following link:
