# User-defined Automated Response Playbooks are available in the Security Playbooks app

Security Playbooks now enables you to create Automatic Response Playbooks from scratch with a flexible workflow, while still allowing you to create the playbooks from a fully customizable template.

In addition to "highly suspicious" and "suspicious" highlighted objects, you can use Automatic Response Playbooks to take response actions on other "unrated" highlighted objects in Workbench alerts.

Additionally, Security Playbooks provides one more response action "Submit URL to sandbox" to help you quickly respond to Workbench alerts.
