# Configuring internal network traffic with Open vSwitch (SPAN)

Configure internal network traffic with the Open vSwitch using to allow Virtual Network Sensor to monitor data.

:::note

The following instructions are valid as of October 2023.
:::

Before you begin, make sure you have [prepared a vSwitch](preparing-vswitch.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Access Terminal on the host machine.

2.  Verify the name of the network interface you want to configure as the SPAN destination and source.

    1.  List virtual machines.

        `virsh list --all`

    2.  Check the name of the network interface for the virtual machines.

        `virsh domiflist VM-1`

    3.  Repeat for all other virtual machines (VM-2, VM-3, etc.).

3.  Clear mirror settings.

    `ovs-vsctl clear bridge ovsbr mirrors`

4.  Configure SPAN settings.

    ```bash
    ovs-vsctl \
         -- set bridge ovsbr mirrors=@m \
         -- --id=@s1 get port vnet1 \
         -- --id=@s2 get port vnet2 \
         -- --id=@d get port vnet0 \
         -- --id=@m create mirror name=m0 select-dst-port=@s1,@s2 select-src-port=@s1,@s2 output-port=@d select-all=true
    ```

    :::note

    The example code uses `vnet0` as the destination and `vnet1`, `vnet2` as the source. You can change the port names to suit the needs of your deployment.
    :::

5.  Verify mirror settings.

    `ovs-vsctl -- list bridge`

    `ovs-vsctl -- list mirror`

    After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command `show traffic` to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic. For more information about troubleshooting, see [Virtual Network Sensor FAQ](virtual-network-sensor-faqs.mdx) and [Virtual Network Sensor CLI commands](virtual-network-sensor-cli-commands.mdx).
