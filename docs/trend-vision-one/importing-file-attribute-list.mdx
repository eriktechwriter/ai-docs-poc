# Importing a File Attribute List

Use this option if you have a properly-formatted `.dat` file containing the file attribute lists. You can generate the file by exporting the file attribute lists from either the server you are currently accessing or from another server.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Data Identifiers**.

2.  Click the **File Attribute** tab.

3.  Click **Import** and then locate the `.dat` file containing the file attribute lists.

4.  Click **Open**.

    A message appears, informing you if the import was successful. If a file attribute list to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
