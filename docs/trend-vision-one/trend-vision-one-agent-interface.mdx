The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security Agent Interface enables end users to interact with the agent program on managed endpoints. The agent interface provides information about the installed agent and certain policy configurations, and allows the user to run scans or update the agent manually. You can manage agent interface settings such as enabling alerts, customizing alert messages, and controlling end-user access from the [Agent Interface](policies-agent-interface.mdx) screen in Endpoint Security Policies.

Endpoint users can hover the mouse over the system tray icon (![](/images/AgentConsoleSysTrayIcon=4c51e4c9-adf0-4be5-84e1-0b23390537aa.webp)) to get a quick glance at the agent status, and click on the icon to open the agent console.
