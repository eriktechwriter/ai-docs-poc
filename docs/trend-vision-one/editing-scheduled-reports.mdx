# Editing Scheduled Reports

Use the **Scheduled Reports** screen to automatically generate reports on a user-defined schedule. When adding scheduled reports, specify whether to use custom or static templates.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Detections → Reports → Scheduled Reports**.

    The **Scheduled Reports** screen appears.

2.  Click the *Name* of a scheduled report profile.

    The **Edit Scheduled Report \> Step 1: Contents** screen appears.

3.  Type a name for the report in the **Name** field.

4.  (Optional) Type a description for the report in the **Description** field.

5.  In the **Report Content** section, select one of the following template types:

    - **Custom Templates**: Select one or more custom report templates.

      :::note

      Selecting multiple custom templates generates a single report that displays formatted data from all selected templates.

      For more information about creating custom report templates, see [Adding or Editing Custom Templates](adding-or-editing-custom-templates.mdx).
      :::

    - **Static Templates**: Select one or more of the static templates provided by Trend Micro.

      1.  Select a static template from the **Report category** drop-down.

      2.  Select the data to display in the report and specify any corresponding parameters.

6.  Select the report generation format.

    - Custom template report formats:

      - Adobe PDF format (\*.pdf)

      - HTML format (\*.html)

      - XML format (\*.xml)

      - CSV format (\*.csv)

    - Static template report formats:

      - Adobe PDF format (\*.pdf)

      - Microsoft Word format (\*.docx)

      - Microsoft Excel format (\*.xlsx)

7.  Click **Next**.

    The **Edit Scheduled Report \> Step 2: Targets** screen appears.

8.  Specify targets using one of the following views.

    - **Product Directory**: Select the managed products or folders containing the managed products that provide the report information.

    - **Tags and filters**: Select up to 10 custom tags, filters, or important labels containing the users or endpoints that provide the report information.

      :::note

      - The **Tags and filters** view is only available for custom report templates.

      - Reports generated by a user account only include data from endpoints that the user account is authorized to view. If a user account selects a tag, filter, or importance label containing endpoints that the user account does not have permission to view, then the generated report excludes data from the unauthorized endpoints.

      - Editing a tag, filter, or importance label on the **User/Endpoint Directory** screen also modifies the corresponding tag, filter, or importance label used by log queries and reports. For example, if the an endpoint is removed from a custom filter on the **User/Endpoint Directory** screen, then log queries and generated reports that use the filter will exclude data from the removed endpoint.

9.  If the report contains data from a Network VirusWall Enforcer device, specify the clients from which the reports generate:

    - **All clients**: Generates reports from all Network VirusWall Enforcer devices

    - **IP range**: Generates reports from a specific IP address range

    - **Segment**: Generates reports from a specific network segment

10. Click **Next**.

    The **Edit Scheduled Report \> Step 3: Frequency** screen appears.

11. Specify how often the reports generate:

    - **Every 'n' days**: Reports generate every 1 to 6 days, depending on your selection.

    - **Monthly**: Reports generate monthly on the first, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, or the last day of the month.

12. Specify the data range:

    - **Reports include data up to the Start the schedule time specified below**: This means that a report could have up to 23 hours more data contained in the report. While this has a small affect on weekly or monthly reports, this can make a "daily" report with almost two days worth of data depending on the Start schedule time.

    - **Reports include data up to 23:59:59 of the previous day**: This means that data collection for the report stops just before midnight. Reports will be an exact time period (example: Daily reports will be 24 hours) but will not contain the absolute latest data.

13. Specify when the report schedule starts:

    - **Immediately**: The report schedule starts immediately after enabling the report.

    - **Start on**: The report schedule starts on the date and time specified in the accompanying fields.
