# Enhanced user management for Exchange Online access granting in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection

February 21, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection allows adding or removing users after being granted access to Exchange Online with the "Synchronize selected users" option. Previously, this option did not support user synchronization, making user updates impossible after access was granted. The enhanced user management feature lets administrators review synchronized users and make necessary adjustments, providing greater control and flexibility. This ensures that new users receive Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection protection and allows easier removal of unavailable users.
