# Prevent MTU-related agent communication issues across Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPC)

Agents in different VPCs might experience problems when trying to communicate with Server & Workload Protection. This could be because the network [maximum transmission unit (MTU)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/network_mtu.mdx) supported by Amazon Web Services is 1500 and agent communication traffic can exceed this, which results in fragmented and dropped packets.

You can prevent this MTU-related communication issue from happening by adding a new firewall rule to all firewall policies. The key settings for this new firewall rule are shown in the image below.
