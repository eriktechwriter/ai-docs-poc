Configure an internet access rule to protect your users' internet access whether they are on or off your corporate network.

:::note

- Trend Vision One automatically creates a default internet access rule to apply when no other internet access rules are triggered. The default rule allows unrestricted access to the internet.

- AI service access rules take priority over internet access rules.
