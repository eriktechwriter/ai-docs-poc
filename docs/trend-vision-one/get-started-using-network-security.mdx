# Getting started with Network Security

Accessing Network Security for the first time.

When accessing **Network Security** for the first time, the introductory screen appears. Click **Get Started** to provision **Network Security**.

Once **Network Security** is provisioned, you can access the screens for [Network Inventory](network-inventory.mdx), [Network Analysis Configuration](network-analysis-configuration.mdx), and [Intrusion Prevention Configuration](intrusion-prevention-configuration.mdx).

To start utilizing the detection and response capabilities within **Network Security**, deploy or connect a Trend Micro network security product.

- To deploy a Virtual Network Sensor, see [Virtual Network Sensor deployment guides](network-sensors-deploy-guides.mdx).

- To connect a Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, see [Deep Discovery Inspector connection guides](ddi-connection-deployment.mdx).

- To connect your TippingPoint SMS, see [TippingPoint SMS connection guides](tippingpoint-sms-connection-guides.mdx).

:::note

For new customers, **Network Security** no longer supports connecting Deep Discovery Director to **Network Inventory**. If you have a valid "XDR Add-On: Deep Discovery Inspector" license, your license is converted into credits so you can connect Deep Discovery Inspector appliances and enable the Network Sensor.

If you have already connected Deep Discovery Director to **Network Inventory**, your connection is unaffected and you can continue to use Deep Discovery Director to connect your Deep Discovery Inspector appliances. For more information, see [Network Inventory with Deep Discovery Director](network-inventory-ddd.mdx).
