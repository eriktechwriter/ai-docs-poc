# 4.1.2 - Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Worker Node

Ensure that the `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.

The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Audit {#audit}

Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the \<PATH\>/\<FILENAME\> of the kubelet service config file. Set $kubelet_service_config=\<PATH\> based on the file location on your system:

```bash
export
kubelet_service_config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf
```

To perform the audit manually, run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf
```
