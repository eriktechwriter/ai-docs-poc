# 4.6.2 - Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to RuntimeDefault in the pod definitions (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 2

Enable `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile in the pod definitions.

Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. It should be enabled to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container.

:::note

By default, seccomp profile is set to `unconfined` which means that no seccomp profiles are enabled.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

If the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile is too restrictive for you, you would have to create/manage your own `Localhost` seccomp profiles.

### Audit {#audit}

Review the pod definitions output for all namespaces in the cluster with the command below.

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq -r '.items[] |
select(.metadata.annotations."seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod" ==
"runtime/default" or .spec.securityContext.seccompProfile.type ==
"RuntimeDefault") | {namespace: .metadata.namespace, name: .metadata.name,
seccompProfile: .spec.securityContext.seccompProfile.type}'
```

### Remediation {#remediation}

Use security context to enable the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An example is as below:

```bash
{
    "namespace": "kube-system",
    "name": "metrics-server-v0.7.0-dbcc8ddf6-gz7d4",
    "seccompProfile": "RuntimeDefault"
}
```
