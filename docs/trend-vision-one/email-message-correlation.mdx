# Email Message Correlation

Threat Investigations can correlate information from Endpoint Sensor, Cloud App Security, and Active Directory to display attack information about an endpoint, user account, and possible email attack vectors throughout your network.

The **Email Message** pane displays information about selected email messages associated with the Analysis Chain and provides further details about users within your organization.

The following table highlights some of the correlated data.
