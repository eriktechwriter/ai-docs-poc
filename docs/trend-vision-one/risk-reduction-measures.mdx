# Risk Reduction Measures

View information about high-impact risk events and remediation steps that you must complete to achieve specific risk reduction goals.

**Risk Reduction Measures** provides a structured and targeted approach to reducing your Cyber Risk Index. After you select a risk reduction goal, the widget displays risk events with the highest impact on the Cyber Risk Index, assets most affected, and recommended remediation steps. To access the widget, go to **Threat and Exposure Management → Risk Factors → Risk Reduction Measures**.

:::note

Updating the Cyber Risk Index after remediation might take up to 24 hours to complete, depending on the connected data sources.

The Cyber Risk Index automatically updates every four hours. Changes to the status of risk events are reflected in the Risk Index after up to one hour. You may also manually recalculate the Cyber Risk Index by clicking the **Recalculate** button. Manual recalculations take up to one hour to display.

Updating the Risk Index after remediation might take up to 24 hours to complete, depending on the connected data sources used.

<td><p>To track your remediation progress, you can change the status of risk events. Changing the status of risk events affects individual asset risk scores and ultimately your organization's Cyber Risk Index.</p>
<p>Risk events for all <a href="trend-vision-one-risk-factors">risk factors</a> except for <a href="trend-vision-one-xdr-detection">XDR detection</a> can be marked as one of the five following statuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New</strong>: Newly reported events requiring processing. New events affect individual risk scores and the Cyber Risk Index.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In progress</strong>: Events that are undergoing processing. In progress events affect individual risk scores and the Cyber Risk Index.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remediated</strong>: Events that have been properly handled. Remediated events do not affect the Cyber Risk Index until a new instance of the event is reported.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dismissed</strong>: Events that have been manually marked as posing no risk to your organization. Dismissed events do not affect the Cyber Risk Index until a new instance of the event is reported or an event rule for the risk event is created.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accepted</strong>: Events that have been marked as too difficult or expensive to address. Accepted events continue to affect the Cyber Risk Index until the events are remediated or dismissed.</p></li>
</ul>


:::note

<p>The Cyber Risk Index might take up to 30 minutes to update after changing the status of a risk event.</p>
