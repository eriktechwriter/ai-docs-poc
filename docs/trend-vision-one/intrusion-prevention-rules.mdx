# Intrusion Prevention Rules

:The **Intrusion Prevention Rules** screen displays the Intrusion Prevention Rules supported by Trend Micro Apex Central Vulnerability Protection. Intrusion Prevention Rules examine the actual content of network packets (and sequences of packets). Based on the conditions set within the Intrusion Prevention Rule, various actions are then carried out on these packets. These actions include replacing specifically defined or suspicious byte sequences, or completely dropping packets and resetting the connection.

- To filter the list of rules, use the **Search** box to specify full or partial strings that appear in any of the columns.

- To sort the list of Intrusion Prevention Rules by column data, click a column heading.

- To view detailed Intrusion Prevention Rule Properties, click the link in the *Rule Name* column of a rule.

- To exclude traffic from one or more source endpoints from Vulnerability Protection scanning, click **Configure Exceptions** and specify the source IP addresses.

  :::note

  You can add up to 100 entries to the exception list.
