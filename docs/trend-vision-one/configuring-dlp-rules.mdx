# Configuring Data Loss Prevention Rules

:::note

Data Loss Prevention processes rules and templates by priority. If a rule is set to "Pass", Data Loss Prevention processes the next rule in the list. If a rule is set to "Block" or "User Justification", Data Loss Prevention blocks or accepts the user action and does not process that rule/template further.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select **Enable this rule**.

2.  Specify a name for the rule.

3.  Configure the template settings:

4.  Click the **Template** tab.

5.  Select templates from the **Available templates** list and then click **Add**.

    When selecting templates:

    - Select multiple entries by clicking the template names which highlights the name.

6.  Configure the channel settings:

7.  Click the **Channel** tab.

8.  Select the channels for the rule.

    For details about channels, see [Network Channels](network-channels.mdx) and [System and Application Channels](system-application-channels.mdx).

9.  If you selected any of the network channels, select the transmission scope:

    - **All transmissions**

    - **Only transmissions outside the Local Area Network**

    See [Transmission Scope and Targets for Network Channels](transmission-scope-network-channels.mdx) for details on transmission scope, how targets work depending on the transmission scope, and how to define targets correctly.

10. If you selected **Email clients**:

    1.  Click **Exceptions**.

    2.  Specify monitored and non-monitored internal email domains.

        For details on monitored and non-monitored email domains, see [Email Clients](email-clients.mdx).

11. If you selected **Removable storage**:

    1.  Click **Exceptions**.

    2.  Add non-monitored removable storage devices, identifying them by their vendors. The device model and serial ID are optional.

        The approved list for USB devices supports the use of the asterisk (\*) wildcard. Replace any field with the asterisk (\*) to include all devices that satisfy the other fields.

        For example, \[vendor\]-\[model\]-\* places all USB devices from the specified vendor and the specified model type, regardless of serial ID, to the approved list.

    3.  To add more devices, click the plus (**+**) icon.

12. Configure the action settings:

13. Click the **Action** tab.

14. Select a primary action and any additional actions. For details about actions, see [Data Loss Prevention Actions](data-loss-prevention-actions.mdx).

15. After configuring the **Template**, **Channel**, and **Action** settings, click **Save**.
