# Add a mount point

When you add the Trend Micro File Security Virtual Appliance to your Service Gateway, the Service Gateway appears on the File Security Inventory page. Virtual appliances can have multiple servers, and servers can have multiple mount points with a scanner on each mount point. From this page you can add, modify, remove, or turn off servers and mount points for a specific Virtual Appliance.

Virtual Appliance can be used with the following file systems:

- NFS3, NFS4
- SMB 3.0, SMB 3.1

  :::note

  SMB requires Service Gateway 3.0.19 or higher.
