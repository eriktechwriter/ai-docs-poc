# 4.2.4 - Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace (Automated)

Profile Applicability: Level 1

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `hostNetwork` flag set to `true`.

A container running in the host's network namespace could access the local loopback device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods.

There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to share the host network namespace.

If you need to run containers which require access to the host's network namespaces, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.

:::note

By default, there are no restrictions on the creation of `hostNetwork` containers.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

Pods defined with `spec.hostNetwork: true` will not be permitted unless run under a specific, authorized policy.

### Audit {#audit}

List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy disallows the admission of hostNetwork containers.

Given that manually checking each pod can be time-consuming, especially in large environments, you can use a more automated approach to filter out pods where hostNetwork is set to true. Hereâ€™s a command using kubectl and jq:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq -r '.items[] |
select(.spec.hostNetwork == true) |
"\(.metadata.namespace)/\(.metadata.name)"'

```

OR

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq -r '.items[] |
select(.spec.hostNetwork == true) | select(.metadata.namespace !=
"kube-system" and .metadata.namespace != "gatekeeper-system" and .metadata.namespace
!= "azure-arc" and .metadata.namespace !=
"azure-extensions-usage-system") | "\(.metadata.name)
\(.metadata.namespace)"'
```

When creating a Pod Security Policy, `["kube-system", "gatekeeper-system", "azure-arc", "azure-extensions-usage-system"]` namespaces are excluded by default.

This command retrieves all pods across all namespaces in JSON format, then uses jq to filter out those with the `hostNetwork` flag set to `true`, and finally formats the output to show the namespace and name of each matching pod.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of `hostNetwork` containers.

Pod Security Policies and Assignments can be found by searching for Policies in the Azure Portal. A detailed step-by-step guide can be found here: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes>
