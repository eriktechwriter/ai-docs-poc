# Create a list of IP addresses for use in policies

Create lists of IP addresses so that you can use them in multiple firewall rules. A single list is easier to manage than several identical lists that are each defined in a different rule.

:::tip

To create an IP list that is similar to an existing one, duplicate the list and then edit it.
:::

You can enter an individual IP address, or you can enter IP ranges and masked IPs. You can also insert comments into your IP list by preceding the text with a hash sign ("#").

Masked IP examples are 192.168.0/24, 192.168.2.0/255.255.255.0, and for IPV6 2001:0DB8::CD30:0:0:0:0/60. IP range examples are 192.168.0.2 - 192.168.0.125 and, for IPV6, FF01::101 - FF01::102

## See which rules use an IP list {#see-which-rules-use-an-ip-list}
