# Updating the add-in for Outlook

The Add-in for Outlook automatically updates when a new version with minor changes is available. A manual update is required only when major changes are available, for which Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will make announcements.

:::note

- The version number of the Add-in for Outlook is in the format *major*.*minor*.*revision*, such as 1.0.0. The major number reflects major changes, while the minor and revision numbers reflect minor changes. Manual update is necessary when the major number changes.

- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, the version number of the Add-in for Outlook changes only after a manual update, so it can be different from the add-in version number in Outlook.
