# Sender IP match

Cloud Email Gateway Protection allows you to specify an IP address or a range of addresses within a sender domain identified by the *message header address* to allow email messages only from those addresses. Sender IP Match is a way that readily enables you to simultaneously allow all inbound email traffic from a particular domain while equally preventing spoofing by manually defining the allowed IP ranges.

If an email message passes the Sender IP Match check, Cloud Email Gateway Protection skips its own SPF check as well as the SPF check of DMARC authentication for this message.
