# Cloud Email Gateway Protection integration with Domain Verification under Administration

March 19, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection now integrates with the domain verification feature in Trend Vision One. Domains added in Cloud Email Gateway Protection will automatically appear in the **Domain Verification** screen under **Administration**. This integration also allows administrators to verify domains in either Cloud Email Gateway Protection or **Domain Verification**, with the verification results applying to both locations.
