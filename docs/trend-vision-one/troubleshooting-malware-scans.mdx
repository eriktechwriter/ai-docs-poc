# Troubleshooting malware scans

Some special cases may cause the agent not to trigger the offline scheduled scan:

- If the computer is shut down, the upcoming scheduled scan may not be triggered if it times out when the computer is restarted.

- If the computer is shut down during the scheduled scan, the interrupted scheduled scan will not continue when the computer is restarted.
