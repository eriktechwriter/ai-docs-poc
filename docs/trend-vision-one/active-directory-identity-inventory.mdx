# Set up Active Directory (on-premises) requirements and permissions for use in Identity Inventory

Configure your deployed Service Gateway and Active Directory (On-premises) server and grant the required permissions to sync and analyze your identity data.

For Trend Vision One to sync data with your Active Directory (on-premises) server, you must have a deployed Service Gateway with the On-premises Directory Connector installed. To learn more, see [Getting started with Service Gateway](getting-started-service-gateway.mdx).
