# About attack reports

Server & Workload Protection enables you to generate a variety of reports. Reports display data for a time period that you specify. You can generate reports for particular computers, groups of computers, computers using a particular policy. You can also filter for certain event tags. For details on configuring reports, see [Generate reports about alerts and other activity](reports-alerts--activity.mdx).

One of the reports that you can generate is the Attack Report, which contains a summary table and some additional information about the most frequent events. The summary tables provides this information:

<p>Numbers of events where Server &amp; Workload Protection is configured to detect issues and log events, but not take other actions.</p></th>
<th><p><em>Prevent Mode:</em></p>
<p>Numbers of events where Server &amp; Workload Protection is configured to detect issues, generate events, and take some sort of action.</p></th>

<p>For information on how to change the action that Server &amp; Workload Protection takes when it detects malware, see <a href="trend-vision-one-configure-malware-scans">Configure malware scans.</a></p></td>
<td><p><em>Cleaned:</em> Server &amp; Workload Protection cleaned an infected file by terminating processes or deleting registries, files, cookies, or shortcuts, depending on the type of malware.</p>
<p><em>Quarantined:</em> Server &amp; Workload Protection moved an infected file to the "identified files" folder.</p>
<p><em>Deleted:</em> Server &amp; Workload Protection deleted an infected file.</p>
<p><em>Access Denied:</em> Server &amp; Workload Protection prevented an infected file from being accessed, without removing the file from the system.</p>
<p><em>Terminated:</em> A behavior monitoring scan determined that a process was compromised and terminated the process to prevent further infection.

<li><em>Smart:</em> One or more known and unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities. <em>Policy</em> and <em>Info</em> rules are sub-categories for Smart rules.</li>

<p>Intrusion Prevention rules also have an associated severity, depending on the severity of the issue that the rule identifies: <em>Critical, High, Medium, Low</em>.</p></td>
