# Migrating from Service Gateway 1.0 to 3.0

Migrate directly from Service Gateway 1.0 to Service Gateway 3.0 if your current Service Gateway 1.0 appliance status is unhealthy.

The status of a Service Gateway Virtual Appliance must be healthy in order for an upgrade to the latest version to proceed. If your Service Gateway 1.0 status is unhealthy, you may migrate directly to Service Gateway 3.0.

:::note

- To minimize disruption of services during migration, do not change the Service Gateway Management API key before migrating the Service Gateway virtual appliance.

- The source (1.0) and target (3.0) appliances may be temporarily unavailable during migration.
