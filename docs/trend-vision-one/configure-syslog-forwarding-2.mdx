### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administration → Settings → Syslog Settings**.

    The **Syslog Settings** screen appears.

    - **Port**: Syslog server port number

    - **Protocol**: Select the transmission protocol

      :::note

      If **SSL/TLS** is selected, Trend Micro Apex Central accepts valid self-signed certificates by default.

      - If the server certificate contains a Subject Alternative Name, the Subject Alternative Name must contain the server FQDN or IP address.

      - For additional security, use a valid server certificate or upload the server certificate to Trend Micro Apex Central.
      :::

4.  (Optional) To upload a server certificate:

    :::warning[Important]
