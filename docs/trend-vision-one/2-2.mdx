# 2.2 - Ensure that the –client-cert-auth argument is set to true (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Enable client authentication on etcd service.

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service.

:::note

By default, the etcd service can be queried by unauthenticated clients.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

All clients attempting to access the etcd server will require a valid client certificate.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the etcd server node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep etcd
```

Verify that the `--client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter.

```bash
--client-cert-auth="true"
```
