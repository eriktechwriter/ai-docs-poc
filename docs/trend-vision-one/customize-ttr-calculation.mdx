# Customize TTR/TTI calculation

For more flexible control on how you calculate time to respond (TTR) for **Workbench** cases.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To change the TTR calculation, click ![Settings icon](/images/gear_icon=fc9a51ad-35af-4fe3-92c6-5e41b2dfc5d9.webp).

2.  Select from the options:

    - **Original** calculation uses the last manual response action when calculating times to respond and investigate.

    - **Flexible** calculation uses the first of the selected actions to occur. Choose from any combination of these options:

      - **First manual response action**

      - **First response action a security playbook performs on the impact scope or a highlighted object**

      - **First addition of notes or comments**

      - **First time the case is closed**

      - **First time a security playbook closes the case**

      - **First time the findings change**

3.  Click **Save**. This change affects all cases and corresponding [widget](customizing-security-dashboard.mdx) data.
