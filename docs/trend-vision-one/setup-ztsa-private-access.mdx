# Setting up Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access

Prepare your environment with Private Access Connectors, Secure Access Modules, and identify your corporate resources.

Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access requires that you set up your environment and identify your corporate resources before creating rules that control user and device access.

The following lists out the high-level overview of the steps involved in setting up your Zero Trust Private Access environment.

1.  [Integrate your identity and access management (IAM) system](ia-manage-integration-ztsa.mdx) or add [local user accounts](local-user-account-management.mdx).

2.  [Deploy Private Access Connectors](private-access-connector-deployment.mdx) to the cloud and local infrastructure that host your corporate applications.

3.  Choose how your end users and devices can access internal applications.

    - [Deploy the Secure Access Module](secure-access-module-deployment.mdx) to secure end user access through managed devices.

    - [Set up a User Portal](user-portal-for-pa-config.mdx) to allow end users to access applications through a browser.

4.  [Add your internal applications](add-internal-application-pac.mdx) to Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access.

5.  Manage access to corporate resources and the internet with [private access rules](creating-pac-rule.mdx).
