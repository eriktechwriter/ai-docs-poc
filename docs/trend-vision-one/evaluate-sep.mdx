# Evaluate Standard Endpoint Protection

Move selected Trend Micro Apex One agents to Standard Endpoint Protection to experience the new Trend Vision One Endpoint Security.

Before you move any Trend Micro Apex One endpoints to evaluate the new Trend Vision One Endpoint Security, ensure you have completed the following:

1.  Access the Foundation Services Update of the Trend Vision One console.

    - For new users, [activate your Trend Vision One console](accessing-your-console.mdx).

    - For current Trend Vision One users, [upgrade your console to the latest version](update-foundation-services-release.mdx).

2.  [Create a Standard Endpoint Protection instance](creating-new-product-instance.mdx) in Product Instance. You can also [create a new Endpoint Group Manager](creating-new-endpoint-group-manager.mdx) if you want to group your evaluation endpoints together.

    :::note

    You can provision up to five Standard Endpoint Protection Manager instances.
    :::

3.  [Deploy a Service Gateway and configure your firewall settings](deploy-service-gateway-exceptions.mdx).

Once you are ready, use the following guides to connect your Trend Micro Apex One as a Service or Trend Micro Apex Central on-premises products to Product Instance and move your agents. Trend Micro recommends moving agents using the Trend Micro Apex One server console as it is the easiest method and allows for moving multiple agents at a time.

- [Move agents with the IPXfer tool](moving-agents-ipxfer-tool.mdx)

:::note

Once you are satisfied with the evaluation, you can [update your connected Trend Micro Apex One products](existing-apex-one-update.mdx) to Standard Endpoint Protection.
