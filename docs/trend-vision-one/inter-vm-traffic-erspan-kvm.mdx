# Configuring external inter-VM traffic with ERSPAN (KVM host)

Configure network settings to allow Virtual Network Sensor to monitor data.

:::note

The following instructions are valid as of October 2023.

These instructions are only for Virtual Network Sensors deployed on a KVM host machine.
:::

Before you begin, make sure you have [prepared a vSwitch](preparing-vswitch.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the Virtual Network Sensor CLI console, type `show interface` and choose a network interface that shows "Supported" for Encapsulated Remote Mirroring.

    </figure>

2.  Execute the `enable` command.

    </figure>

3.  Execute the `configure interface <network_interface>` command.

4.  Execute the `ip-encap enable [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]` command.

5.  Type `# exit` to return to basic commands and verify that the IP address is shown next to Encapsulated Remote Mirroring.

    After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command `show traffic` to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic.
