# Endpoint-based attack prevention/detection rule application impact now displayed

August 26, 2024—Applying host-based attack prevention/detection rules now impacts asset risk scores in Cyber Risk Exposure Management. When host, or endpoint-based, attack prevention/detection rules are successfully applied to vulnerable assets, the risk score of the assets will be reduced. CVEs that have available attack prevention/detection rules will display an indicator in the corresponding entry on an asset's profile screen, allowing you to more easily see which vulnerabilities can be mitigated. To learn more, see[Attack prevention/detection rules](attack-prevention.mdx).
