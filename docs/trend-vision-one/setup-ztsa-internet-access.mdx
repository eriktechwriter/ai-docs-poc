# Setting up Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access and AI Service Access

Prepare your environment to use Internet Access and AI Service Access with Secure Access Modules or internet proxies.

Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access requires that you set up your environment before creating rules that control user and device access.

The following lists out the high-level overview of the steps involved in setting up your Zero Trust Internet Access environment.

1.  [Integrate your identity and access management (IAM) system](ia-management-integration.mdx) or add [local user accounts](local-user-account-management.mdx).

2.  [Identify your corporate network locations.](identify-corporate-network.mdx)

3.  Choose how your end users and devices send traffic to the Internet Access Gateway.

    - [Deploy the Secure Access Module](secure-access-module-deployment.mdx) to secure end user access through managed devices.

      :::note

      Internet Access authenticates users by requiring users to sign in to the Secure Access Module before forwarding internet traffic to the Internet Access Gateway.
      :::

    - [Configure PAC files](pac-file-configuration.mdx) to use for traffic forwarding.

      :::note

      Internet Access authenticates users by requiring users to sign in on a page that displays when they open a website in a browser.
