# Setting up Cloud Email Gateway Protection

To ensure your organization achieves effective email security protection, Trend Micro recommends you perform the following tasks:

1.  Configure the domain you added and add additional domains if needed.

    Check the status of the domain you added for provisioning and make sure the domain has been configured properly. Add more domains if necessary.

    For details, see [Managing domains](managing-domains.mdx).

2.  Import user directories that will be applied by policies.

    Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides multiple ways to import user directories. Choose the proper way that suits your organization.

    For details, see [Directory management](directory-management-email-security.mdx).

3.  Configure policies to design your organizational protection solution.

    Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides robust email management options, enabling you to customize your email security protection and configure policies to meet the needs of your organization. Cloud Email Gateway Protection is preconfigured with several default domain-level policies (if configured) and default organization-level policies to provide immediate protection upon deployment.

    For details, see [Configuring policies](configuring-policies.mdx).
