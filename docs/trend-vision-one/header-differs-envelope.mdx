# Using message header sender differs from envelope sender criteria

Spoofed messages often have mismatched message header senders (specified by the header "From") and envelope senders (specified by the envelope field "MAIL FROM"). Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides an anti-spoofing check to detect messages with a message header sender different from the envelope sender.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Scanning Criteria** tab, click **Advanced**.

2.  Select **Message header sender differs from envelope sender**.

    :::note

    A message with a blank envelope sender does not match this criteria.
