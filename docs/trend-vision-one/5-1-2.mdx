# 5.1.2 - Minimize access to secrets (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

The Kubernetes API stores secrets, which may be service account tokens for the Kubernetes API or credentials used by workloads in the cluster. Access to these secrets should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users to reduce the risk of privilege escalation.

Inappropriate access to secrets stored within the Kubernetes cluster can allow for an attacker to gain additional access to the Kubernetes cluster or external resources whose credentials are stored as secrets.

:::note

By default in a kubeadm cluster the following list of principals have `get` privileges on `secret` objects.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

Care should be taken not to remove access to secrets to system components which require this for their operation.

### Audit {#audit}

Review the users who have `get`, `list`, or `watch` access to `secrets` objects in the Kubernetes API.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Where possible, remove `get`, `list`, and `watch` access to `secret` objects in the cluster.
