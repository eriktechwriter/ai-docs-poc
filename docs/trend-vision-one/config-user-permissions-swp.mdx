# How do I configure user permissions for Server & Workload Protection

Although Server & Workload Protection features an Administration screen, many of the functions and features have been integrated with Trend Vision One, including managing the permissions for user roles accessing Server & Workload Protection.

To configure a custom user role for Server & Workload Protection, follow the steps below. For more general information, see [User Roles](user-roles-foundation-services.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In your Trend Vision One console, go to **Administration → User Roles**.

2.  Add or edit a custom user role:

    - To add a new custom user role, click **+ Add Role**.

    - To edit a custom user role, select the custom user role and click the **Edit** icon.

      :::note

      To view only custom user roles, select **Role Type: → Custom**. You cannot add or edit a *predefined role*.
      :::

    The **Custom Role Setting** panel opens.

3.  On the **General information** tab, specify the role name and description.

4.  On the **Permissions** tab, select permissions to grant to the role.

    The follow steps are specifically for Server & Workload Protection. You can add additional permissions as needed for your users.

    1.  Under **Security Functions**, locate **Endpoint Security → Server & Workload Protection**.

    2.  Select an access level, or select individual items to customize access.

        Reference the table below for common scenarios and frequently asked configurations.

        <table>
        <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 25%" />
        <col style="width: 25%" />

        <tbody>
        <tr>

        <td><p>Select <strong>Read-Only</strong> for Server &amp; Workload Protection</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        <td><p>Allow users to manage the spyware/grayware exclusion list, including setting identified spyware to "allow" from the event logs screen</p></td>
        <td><p>Must include the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Other Rights → System Settings (Global)</strong> select all permissions</p></li>
        </ul></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

5.  On the **Data and App Assets** tab, select an [asset visibility scope](asset-visibility-management.mdx) or create a new scope for each Trend Vision One app.

    :::warning[Important]

    Make sure the user role you are creating is assigned to an asset visibility scope that includes the Server & Workload Protection Manager instance you want the role to have access to manage. Users cannot manage assets if they do not have visibility.

6.  Click **Save**.
