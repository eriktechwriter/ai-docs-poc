# Connecting TippingPoint SMS 6.1.0 or later to Network Security

Connect a TippingPoint Security Management System (SMS) 6.1.0 or later to Network Security directly over the internet or through an HTTP proxy.

Starting from TippingPoint SMS 6.1.0, connecting a TippingPoint SMS to Trend Vision One no longer requires the use of a Service Gateway. An internal service enables TippingPoint SMS to automatically establish and maintain a connection to Trend Vision One with an enrollment token. The connection can also be established through an HTTP proxy if the TippingPoint SMS does not have a direct internet connection.

:::warning[Important]

- **Intrusion Prevention Configuration** currently only supports policy enforcement on the first TippingPoint SMS connected to Trend Vision One. Support for policy enforcement on multiple TippingPoint SMS deployments is coming soon.

- To enable the Suspicious Object Sync function on TippingPoint SMS 6.1.0, you must connect the TippingPoint SMS to Trend Vision One through a Service Gateway.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Generate an API key to access the SMS Web API.

    1.  From your SMS interface, select **Admin → Authentication and Authorization → Roles** and verify that the role for the selected user account has the `Access SMS Web Services` capability enabled.

    2.  Select **Admin → Authentication and Authorization → Users**.

    3.  Select the user account, and click **Edit**.

    4.  Click **Regenerate API Key** to get a new API key.

        You can reset the API key for any reason. But when you do, from this point, the previous API key can no longer be used.

2.  If your TippingPoint SMS does not have a direct connection to the internet, configure an HTTP proxy.

    1.  In the TippingPoint SMS client, go to **Admin → Server Properties** and click the **Network** tab.

    2.  In the **HTTP Proxy** section, select **Proxy Internet Connections**.

    3.  Enter the IP address or hostname of the proxy server in the **Proxy Server Host** field.

    4.  Enter the port of the proxy server in the **Proxy Server Port** field.

    5.  If the proxy server requires authentication, select **Use Proxy Authentication** and provide the user name and password in the **Username** and **Password** fields, respectively.

    6.  Click **Apply**.

3.  Configure a TippingPoint SMS connector in Trend Vision One.

    - For customers that have updated to the [Foundation Services release](update-foundation-services-release.mdx), go to **Service Management → Product Instance**.

    - For customers using the legacy Trend Vision One console, go to **Point Product Connection → Product Connector**.

    Alternatively:

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Network Security → Network Inventory**.

    2.  Select the **Continue with TippingPoint** deployment option.

    3.  Click **Connect a TippingPoint SMS**.

    4.  Follow the steps in the connection guide dialog for configuring a Service Gateway (if required), generating an enrollment token using the **Product Instance** app, and connecting your SMS to Trend Vision One using the SMS Client interface.

4.  Connect your TippingPoint SMS to Trend Vision One.

    1.  On the TippingPoint SMS web management console, go to **Administration → Connect to Trend Vision One**.

    2.  Click **Configure**.

    3.  Paste the enrollment token into the **Enrollment Token** field.

        Using an enrollment token automatically provisions a one-year Trend Vision One certificate. The certificate automatically renews 30 days before expiration to avoid any gaps in security protection.

    4.  (Optional) If you would like to submit suspicious URL objects for sandbox analysis, enable the Cloud Sandbox URL analysis.

        1.  In the **Cloud Sandbox URL Analysis** section, enable the **State** toggle.

        2.  In the **Saved Query** dropdown menu, select your desired query.

    5.  Click **Test Connectivity** to verify that the TippingPoint SMS can connect to Trend Vision One.

    6.  Click **Save**.

5.  Verify the connection status.

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console:

        - For customers that have updated to the [Foundation Services release](update-foundation-services-release.mdx), go to **Point Product Connection → Product Instance**.

        - For customers using the legacy Trend Vision One console, go to **Point Product Connection → Product Connector**.

    2.  Check that the **Connection status** for TippingPoint Security Management System is green.

    Devices managed by the TippingPoint SMS can be viewed in **Network Security → Network Inventory**.

6.  To check for vulnerabilities and receive policy recommendations in Trend Vision One, enable the TippingPoint SMS as an Cyber Risk Exposure Management data source.

    1.  In the Trend Vision One console, go to **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Cyber Risk Overview**.

    2.  Click **Data sources**.

    3.  In the **Trend Micro Security Services** section, click **TippingPoint Security Management System**.

    4.  Enable **Data upload permission** to allow the TippingPoint SMS to provide data for more comprehensive risk insights into your network activity.
