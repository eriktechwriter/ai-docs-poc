# Endpoints with Threats Widget

This widget displays information about endpoints with security threat detections.

Use the **Range** drop-down to select the time period for the data that displays.

Click the **Important Users** or **Other Users** tabs to switch between the different views.

The table lists affected users in order by critical threat type severity first, and then by the number of threat detections for the user.

- Click the number in the *Threats* column for the user you want to view.

The *Most Critical Threat* column displays the following threat types.
