# Network Channels

Data Loss Prevention can monitor data transmission through the following network channels:

- Email clients

- FTP

- HTTP and HTTPS

- IM applications

- SMB protocol

- Webmail

To determine data transmissions to monitor, Data Loss Prevention checks the transmission scope, which you need to configure. Depending on the scope that you selected, Data Loss Prevention will monitor all data transmissions or only transmissions outside the Local Area Network (LAN).
