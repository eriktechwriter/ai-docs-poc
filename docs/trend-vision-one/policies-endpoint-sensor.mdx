Configure and manage the Endpoint Sensor module settings.

:::warning[Important]

- Policies are "Pre-release" features and are not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- This feature is not available in all regions.

- Enabling Endpoint Sensor requires allocating credits for each endpoint assigned to the policy.

- Navigating between the security modules or leaving the **Policy Settings** screen discards any unsaved changes. To avoid losing your work, always click **Save** before leaving the current screen.

- To enhance blocking of URLs and domains added to your suspicious objects list, enable the [browser extension](policies-browser-extension.mdx) on your endpoints.

Endpoint Sensor gathers activity data for state-of-the-art threat detection and alerting.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  To monitor and gather security data using Endpoint Sensor, select **Enable**.

2.  Configure the **Monitoring level**.

    **Monitoring level** is the degree of vigilance and strictness applied when detecting and responding to potential threats. Higher monitoring levels provide greater sensitivity but might generate a large number of nonessential logs and impact endpoint performance. Trend Micro recommends setting your monitoring level to **2 - Moderate** for more relevant data with minimal impact on your endpoints.

3.  To allow the agent to analyze video calls to detect possible deepfake audio and images, select **Enable** for **Deepfake detector**.

    :::warning[Important]

    Deepfake detector only supports Windows deployments.
