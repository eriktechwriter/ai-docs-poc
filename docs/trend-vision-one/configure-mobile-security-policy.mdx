# Configuring mobile security policies

Use security policies to monitor the security status of your managed devices.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Mobile Security â†’ Mobile Security Policies**.

2.  On the **Android** or **iOS/PadOS** tab, click **Create**.

3.  Under **General**, specify the policy name and description, set the priority of the policy, and click **Next**.

    The **Priority** has two options:

    - **Highest**: Select this to make the policy a top priority. It will be evaluated before all other policies.

    - **Lowest**: Select this if the policy should be a lower priority. It will be evaluated after all other policies, with the exception of the default policy. The default policy is always the last to be evaluated regardless of other settings. If you set a policy to **Lowest**, the policy will be evaluated just before the default policy.

    :::tip

    After the policy is created, you can change the priority by dragging the policy up or down the policy list.
    :::

4.  Under **Security Settings**, configure Malware Detection, Wi-Fi Protection, and Web Reputation settings, and click **Next**.

    The security settings for Android devices differ slightly from those for iOS and iPadOS devices.

    <p>For this feature to work, make sure that you have deployed Service Gateway in your network with the Forward Proxy Service enabled and properly configured to allow connection to destination services. If you have deployed multiple Service Gateways in the network, the Mobile Agent will connect to any Service Gateway based on availability.</p>


    :::warning[Important]

    <li><p>Compared with Service Gateway, Zero Trust Secure Access (ZTSA) provides more powerful Internet access control functionality. If your network is using ZTSA with Internet Access and AI Service Access enabled, Mobile Agents in the network will send traffic to ZTSA instead of the Service Gateway proxy service.</p></li>

5.  Under **Assignment** tab, assign the policy to your assignment groups by selecting one or more groups and clicking **Save**.

    The users or devices targeted by your policy are evaluated for security when they check in with **Mobile Security**.
