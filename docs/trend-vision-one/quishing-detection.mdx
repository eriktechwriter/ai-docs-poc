Detect phishing by scanning the QR codes in email body and attachments

Quishing, also known as QR code phishing, is a type of phishing that uses QR codes to deceive users into visiting malicious websites and revealing sensitive information. To protect your organization against quishing attacks, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection can scan the QR codes in the email body and attachments for security threats.
