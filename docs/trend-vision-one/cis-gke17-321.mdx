# 3.2.1 - Ensure that the Anonymous Auth is Not Enabled Draft (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1

Disable anonymous requests to the Kubelet server.

When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests.

:::note

See the GKE documentation for the default value.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

Anonymous requests will be rejected.

### Audit {#audit}

Audit Method 1:

Kubelets can accept configuration from a configuration file and in some cases from command line arguments. It is important to note that parameters provided as command line arguments will override their counterpart parameters in the configuration file (see `--config` details in the [Kubelet CLI Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) for more info, where you can also find out which configuration parameters can be supplied as a command line argument). With this in mind, it is important to check for the existence of command line arguments as well as configuration file entries when auditing Kubelet configuration.

1.  SSH to each node and execute the following command to find the Kubelet process:

    ```bash
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

    The output of the above command provides details of the active Kubelet process, from which we can see the command line arguments provided to the process. Also note the location of the configuration file, provided with the `--config` argument, as this will be needed to verify configuration.

2.  The file can be viewed with a command like `more` or `less`:

    ```bash
    sudo less /path/to/kubelet-config.json
    ```

3.  Verify that Anonymous Authentication is not enabled. This may be configured as a command line argument to the kubelet service with `--anonymous-auth=false` or in the kubelet configuration file with `"authentication": { "anonymous": { "enabled": false }`.

Audit Method 2:

It is also possible to review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the /configz endpoint of the Kubernetes API. Use `kubectl` to proxy your requests to the API.

1.  Discover all nodes in your cluster by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

2.  Initiate a proxy with `kubectl` on a local port of your choice, like:

    ```bash
    kubectl proxy --port=8080
    ```

3.  With this running, in a separate terminal run the following command for each node:

    ```bash
    export NODE_NAME=my-node-name
    curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/nodes/${NODE_NAME}/proxy/configz
    ```

    The curl command will return the API response which will be a JSON formatted string representing the Kubelet configuration.

4.  Verify that Anonymous Authentication is not enabled checking that `"authentication": { "anonymous": { "enabled": false }` is in the API response.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Remediation Method 1:

If configuring via the Kubelet config file, first locate the file:

1.  SSH to each node and execute the following command to find the kubelet process:

    ```bash
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

    The output of the above command provides details of the active kubelet process, from which we can see the location of the configuration file provided to the kubelet service with the `--config` argument.

2.  The file can be viewed with a command like `more` or `less`:

    ```bash
    sudo less /path/to/kubelet-config.json
    ```

3.  Disable Anonymous Authentication by setting the following parameter:

    ```bash
    "authentication": { "anonymous": { "enabled": false } }
    ```

Remediation Method 2:

1.  If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file on each worker node and ensure the below parameters are part of the `KUBELET_ARGS` variable string.
2.  For systems using `systemd`, such as the Amazon EKS Optimized Amazon Linux or Bottlerocket AMIs, then this file can be found at` /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf`.
3.  Otherwise, you may need to look up documentation for your chosen operating system to determine which service manager is configured: `--anonymous-auth=false`.

For Both Remediation Steps:

Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service and check the service status. The following example is for operating systems using `systemd`, such as the Amazon EKS Optimised Amazon Linux or Bottlerocket AMIs, and invokes the `systemctl` command. If `systemctl` is not available then you will need to look up documentation for your chosen operating system to determine which service manager is configured:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
systemctl status kubelet -l
```
