# Compliance Indicators

This section of the **Security Posture** tab provides information about the antivirus pattern compliance level or the Data Loss Prevention compliance level of your network.

As your network compliance level changes, the color of the compliance indicator icon changes to reflect the thresholds configured on the **Active Directory and Compliance Settings** screen.

The default view displays information for the **Antivirus pattern compliance** indicator.

:::note

Changing the compliance indicator also changes the compliance level information that displays in the **Security Posture** chart.
:::

To change the compliance information that displays, click the name of the selected compliance indicator next to the down arrow icon (![](/images/dashboard_soc_down_arrow=GUID-36A1577A-0130-407F-A492-6046B92657FB=1=en-us=Low.webp)) and select one of the following indicators from the drop-down.
