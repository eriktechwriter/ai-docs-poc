# Security Playbooks

Automate a wide variety of actions, from assessment of your environment to remediation actions.

Security playbooks enable automation of a variety of actions, helping reduce workload while speeding up security tasks and investigations. You can create playbooks from scratch or use templates to create playbooks and customize the settings within each [playbook node](playbook-nodes.mdx) to suit your specific needs. Depending on the playbook type, you can designate the playbooks to run manually, periodically, or automatically in response to a trigger.

The following table outlines the tabs available in the **Security Playbooks** app (**Workflow and Automation â†’ Security Playbooks**).
