# Vulnerability scan hardware sizing requirements

::View the minimum hardware requirements for running vulnerability scans in Network Vulnerability Scanner to ensure the best performance.

To run vulnerability scans, you require one or more deployed Service Gateways with the Network Vulnerability Scanner service installed. The recommended configuration and virtual hardware requirements depend on the number of assets you intend to scan.

The following table details the Service Gateway hardware and configuration recommendations for daily vulnerability scans according to asset total.

:::warning[Important]

Network Vulnerability Scanner is a memory-intensive service. Make sure you have sufficient memory capacity reserved in your Service Gateways. The information presented on this page is based on experimental results under ideal network conditions within Trend Micro's internal network. The requirements remain the same, but results may vary when used in your organization's environment.

:::tip

The following tips can help you optimize scan performance:

- When scanning large numbers of IP addresses, break any large IP ranges into smaller segments.

- Run multiple concurrent scans of fewer IP addresses instead of single scans of larger numbers of IP addresses whenever possible.

- In large network environments, deploy and use multiple Service Gateways.
:::

The following table shows the average scan time of a single asset for each supported platform using a single scan configuration.

:::note

Actual scan durations may be longer than the times stated in the table due to information collection and report generation. You can find the actual scan duration in the scan report for each scan.
