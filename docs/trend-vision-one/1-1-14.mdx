# 1.1.14 - Ensure that the default administrative credential file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Ensure that the `admin.conf` (and `super-admin.conf` file, where it exists) file ownership is set to `root:root`.

As part of initial cluster setup, default kubeconfig files are created to be used by the administrator of the cluster. These files contain private keys and certificates which allow for privileged access to the cluster. You should set their file ownership to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the file. The file(s) should be owned by `root:root`.

:::note

By default, `admin.conf` and `super-admin.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

On Kubernetes version 1.29 and higher run the following command as well.

```bash
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/super-admin.conf
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.

```bash
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

On Kubernetes 1.29+ the `super-admin.conf` file should also be modified, if present.

```bash
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/super-admin.conf
```
