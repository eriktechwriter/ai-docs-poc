# Deploy with Node.js SDK

Use the Trend Vision One™ File Security Node.js SDK to scan files for malware.

The Node.js SDK for Trend Vision One™ File Security empowers you to craft applications which seamlessly integrate with File Security. With this SDK you can perform a thorough scan of data and artifacts within your applications to identify potential malicious elements.

Follow the steps below to set up your development environment and configure your project, laying the foundation to effectively use File Security.

**Related information**

- [Node.js API reference](node-js-api-reference.md "An API reference for the Node.js SDK for Trend Vision One File Security")
- [Code example](code-example.md "An example of Node.js code for the SDK for Trend Vision One File Security")
- [Common errors](common-errors.md "Common errors encountered when using the Node.js SDK for Trend Vision One File Security")

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before installing the SDK, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js 16.20.1+, 18.x or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- Trend Vision One account associated with your region

- [Configuring custom user roles](custom-user-roles-trend-vision-one.mdx) with File Security permissions

When you have all the prerequisites, continue with creating an API key.

## Create an API key {#create-an-api-key}

The File Security SDK requires a valid API key provided as a parameter to the SDK client object. Trend Vision One API keys are associated with different regions. Refer to [the region flag below](deploying-python-sdk.mdx) to obtain a better understanding of the valid regions associated with the API key.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Administrations → API Keys**.

2.  Click **Add API Key**.

3.  Configure the API key to use the role with the **Run file scan via SDK** permission.

4.  Verify that the API key is associated with the region you plan to use.

5.  Set an expiry time for the API key and make a record of it for future reference.

## Install the SDK {#install-the-sdk}

### Procedure {#procedure-1}

1.  Ensure you have already created the API key.

2.  Run the following commands in your Node.js application folder to install the Node.js package.

    ```bash
    npm install file-security-sdk
    ```

3.  Continue to authenticating.

## Authenticate {#authenticate}

### Procedure {#procedure-2}

1.  Supply the AMaaSHostName and API Key to initiate a new instance of the AmaasGrpcClient.

    ```bash
    import { AmaasGrpcClient } from "file-security-sdk";
    ```

2.  Use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) with or without a port. Replace `__REGION__` with the region of your Trend Vision One account.

    ```bash
    const amaasHostName = "antimalware.__REGION__.cloudone.trendmicro.com:443";
    ```

3.  Use the region. Replace `__REGION__` with the region of your Trend Vision One account.

    ```bash
    const amaasHostName = __REGION__;
    ```

4.  Replace `__YOUR_OWN_VISION_ONE_API_KEY__` with your own Trend Vision One API key.

    ```bash
    const key = __YOUR_OWN_VISION_ONE_API_KEY__;
    ```

5.  Create a new instance of the `AmaasGrpcClient` class using the key.

    ```bash
    const scanClient = new AmaasGrpcClient(amaasHostName, key);
    ```
