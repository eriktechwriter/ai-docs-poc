# Credit allocation models

Understand different models for allocating credits to Trend Vision One features.

Different Trend Vision One features use different credit allocation models, including the following:

- For some features, credits are allocated depending on your configurations when you enable the feature.

  For example, if you deploy a sensor on several assets, when you enable the feature, credits are allocated to that feature based on the number of deployments. If you remove one or more deployments or otherwise disable the feature, the allocated credits automatically return to your available credit balance.

- For other features, you can manually allocate credits based on your predicted usage.

  For features that support manual allocation, you can type a value on the credit settings configuration screen for that feature, and credits are allocated based on that value. You can adjust the value at any time to allocate more or fewer credits to the feature, or set the value to 0 to disable the feature.

- Starting in April 2025, XDR for Cloud uses a usage reservation model for credit allocation.

  Similar to manual allocation, you can enter a **Usage reservation** value in the **Credit settings** drawer for XDR for Cloud. Choose a usage reservation value based on your projected usage over the usage period, which is typically one year. However, if your actual usage exceeds your specified usage reservation, your allocated credits are automatically increased. This model assists with the difficulty of estimating your yearly usage of a feature in advance.

  :::warning[Important]

  Once credits are allocated to XDR for Cloud, you cannot reallocate or return the credits to your credit balance until the usage period ends. At the end of the usage period, your actual usage becomes the default usage reservation for the next usage period. At that time, if you no longer want to use XDR for Cloud, you can adjust your usage reservation to 0 and manage your configurations to disable the feature.

  In Credits & Billing, the **Usage** field for XDR for Cloud displays your actual usage and your original usage reservation. The **Credits allocated** field reflects the number of credits allocated based on your actual usage.
