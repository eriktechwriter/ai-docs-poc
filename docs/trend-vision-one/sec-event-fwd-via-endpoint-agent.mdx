# Security event forwarding via Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent

Enable sharing security event information from an on-premises Active Directory server with Trend Vision One.

Configuring security event forwarding enhances visibility into identity-related risks by allowing Active Directory to share the following security event information with Trend Vision One:

- Object access events

- Logon/logoff events

- System events

- Account management events

This function is now achieved using the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent with the Identity Security Sensor - Active Directory enabled, replacing the previous requirements to install a separate Active Directory Connector.

:::warning[Important]

Security event forwarding via Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

This feature is not available in all regions.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration → Active Directory (on-premises)**.

2.  Use the toggle to enable Active Directory integration.

3.  [Configure data synchronization and user access control](adfs-user-access-control.mdx).

4.  Go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Inventory**, and click **Agent Installer** to deploy the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent.

    :::note

    Identity Security Sensor – Active Directory is supported on any of the following types of agents. Ensure you install the correct agent package on more Active Directory servers in your network.

    - Server & Workload Protection

    - Endpoint Sensor
    :::

    For detailed deployment instructions, see [Manage your agent deployments](manage-your-agent-deployments.mdx).

5.  Configure an endpoint security policy and enable Identity Security Sensor - Active Directory in the policy settings.

    1.  Go to **Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Endpoint Security Policies → Policies**.

    2.  Click **Create policy**.

        The **Create policy** window appears.

    3.  Specify the **Policy name**.

        Trend Micro recommends using a name that is easy to search and identify the purpose of the policy.

    4.  From the **Identity Security Sensor** drop-down list, select **Enable**.

6.  Monitor agent deployment status and verify that agents are functioning correctly.

    :::note

    For customers that have previously deployed the Active Directory Connector, you can still view the Active Directory Connector deployments in **Third-Party Integration → Active Directory (on-premises)**.
