# 5.6.2 - Ensure use of VPC-native clusters (Automated)

:Profile applicability: Level 1

Create Alias IPs for the node network CIDR range in order to subsequently configure IP-based policies and firewalling for pods. A cluster that uses Alias IPs is called a VPC-native cluster.

Using Alias IPs has several benefits:

- Pod IPs are reserved within the network ahead of time, which prevents conflict with other compute resources.
- The networking layer can perform anti-spoofing checks to ensure that egress traffic is not sent with arbitrary source IPs.
- Firewall controls for Pods can be applied separately from their nodes.
- Alias IPs allow Pods to directly access hosted services without using a NAT gateway.

:::note

By default, VPC-native (using alias IP) is enabled when you create a new cluster in the Google Cloud Console, however this is disabled when creating a new cluster using the gcloud CLI, unless the `--enable-ip-alias` argument is specified.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

You cannot currently migrate an existing cluster that uses routes for Pod routing to a cluster that uses Alias IPs.

Cluster IPs for internal services remain only available from within the cluster. If you want to access a Kubernetes Service from within the VPC, but from outside of the cluster, use an internal load balancer.

### Audit {#audit}

Using Google Cloud Console:

1.  Go to [Kubernetes Engine website](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list).
2.  From the list of clusters, click on the desired cluster to open the Details page.
3.  Under the Networking section, make sure VPC-native traffic routing is set to `Enabled`.

Using Command Line:

To check Alias IP is enabled for an existing cluster, run the following command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters describe <cluster_name> --zone <compute_zone>
--format json | jq '.ipAllocationPolicy.useIpAliases'
```

The output of the above command should return `true`, if VPC-native (using alias IP) is enabled. If VPC-native (using alias IP) is disabled, the above command will return null (`{ }`).

### Remediation {#remediation}

Alias IPs cannot be enabled on an existing cluster. To create a new cluster using Alias IPs, follow the instructions below.

Using Google Cloud Console:

If using Standard configuration mode:

1.  Go to [Kubernetes Engine website](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list).
2.  Click **CREATE CLUSTER**, and select Standard configuration mode.
3.  Configure your cluster as desired , then click **Networking** under CLUSTER in the navigation pane.
4.  In the VPC-native section, leave Enable VPC-native (using alias IP) selected.
5.  Click **CREATE**.

If using Autopilot configuration mode:

:::note

This is VPC-native only, and cannot be disabled.
:::

1.  Go to [Kubernetes Engine website](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list).
2.  Click **CREATE CLUSTER**, and select Autopilot configuration mode.
3.  Configure your cluster as required.
4.  Click **CREATE**.

Using Command Line To enable Alias IP on a new cluster, run the following command:

```bash
 gcloud container clusters create <cluster_name> --zone <compute_zone> --enable-ip-alias
```

If using Autopilot configuration mode:

```bash
gcloud container clusters create-auto <cluster_name> --zone <compute_zone>
```
