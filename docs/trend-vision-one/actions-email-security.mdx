# "modify" actions

"Modify" actions change the message or its attachments. The original sender will still receive the modified message, assuming that the message does not trigger other policy rules with "Intercept" actions.

:::note

Note that the "Modify" actions may destroy the existing DKIM signatures in email messages. If this occurs, the messages cannot pass DKIM verification by the downstream mail server.
