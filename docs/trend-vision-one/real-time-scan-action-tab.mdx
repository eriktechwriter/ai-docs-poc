# Real-time Scan: Action Tab

On the **Actions** tab, configure the scan actions Apex One (Mac) performs on detected security threats.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Under **Action**, specify the scan actions.

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 40%" />
    <col style="width: 60%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th><p>Option</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Use ActiveAction</strong></td>
    <td><p>ActiveAction is a set of pre-configured scan actions for different types of security risks. If you are unsure which scan action is suitable for a certain type of security risk, Trend Micro recommends using ActiveAction.</p>
    <p>ActiveAction settings are constantly updated in the pattern files to protect endpoints against the latest security risks and the latest methods of attacks.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Use the same action for all security risk types</strong></td>
    <td><p>Select this option if you want the same action performed on all types of security risks, except probable virus/malware. For Probable Virus/Malware, the action is always "Pass".</p>
    <p>If you choose "Clean" as the first action, select a second action that Apex One (Mac) performs if cleaning is unsuccessful. If the first action is not "Clean", no second action is configurable.</p>
    <p>For details about scan actions, see <a href="trend-vision-one-scan-actions">Scan Actions</a>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

2.  Select **Display a notification message on the agent endpoint when virus/malware is detected** to display a notification message when Apex One (Mac) detects a security risk during Real-time Scan.
