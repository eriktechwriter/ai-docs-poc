# AWS Well-Architected Framework compliance standards update for CREM Cloud Risk Management Users

April 14, 2025—We've updated the AWS Well-Architected Framework compliance standard report and the associated rule mappings by adding the latest version of the Framework, released in March 2025.

:::warning[Important]

- Effective from June 1, 2025, the AWS Well-Architected Framework (updated October 2023) compliance standard will no longer be available. You will not be able to access the standard in the filters and create new reports or generate reports with existing configurations with the old standard. But you will have access to old PDF/CSV reports.

- We recommend updating your report configurations to use the latest versions of the AWS Well-Architected Framework by June 1, 2025 to avoid any disruptions in your reports generation and compliance scores.
