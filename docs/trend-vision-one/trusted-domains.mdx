# Trust Relationships

View information about trust relationships of a domain in Active Directory (on-premises).

The **Trust Relationships** tab allows you to view domains that have established trust relationships with the current domain you selected in the **DOMAIN** section on the left panel. Users authorized to authenticate into one domain can also authenticate into trusted domains with a relationship to the user's primary domain. The more trusted domains you have, the more resources users can access across the system. Limit or restrict trust relationships for domains to ensure users only have access to necessary resources.

The following table details the columns on the **Trust Relationships** tab.
