# Filtering by Criteria

Use this option to allocate endpoints automatically based on the filtering criteria.

This option:

- Is only available on the following managed products:

  - Apex One (Mac)

  - Apex One Data Loss Prevention

  - Apex One Security Agent

  - Mobile Security for Enterprise

  - Trend Micro Endpoint Application Control

- Uses a filter to automatically assign current and future targets to the policy

- Is useful for deploying standard settings to a group of targets

Administrators can change the priority of filtered policies in the policy list. When an administrator reorders the policy list, Trend Micro Apex Central re-assigns the targets to different filtered policies based on the target criteria and the user roles of each policy creator.

Trend Micro Apex Central can only assign endpoints without policies to a new filtered policy. To re-allocate an endpoint already assigned to a filtered policy, move another filtered policy with the matching criteria up the priority list.

See [Assigning Endpoints to Filtered Policies](assigning-filtered-policies.mdx) for more information on how Trend Micro Apex Central assign targets to filtered policies.
