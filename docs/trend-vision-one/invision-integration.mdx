# Invision integration

Set up the Invision integration to enable Invision to retrieve report data from Trend Vision One for cyber insurance evaluation.

This integration allows Invision to retrieve report data from Trend Vision One to generate the Invision Insights Report. The report provides a snapshot of key elements of your cyber risk posture, helping Invision quickly and accurately assess your risk to offer appropriate, competitive insurance terms for your business.

Through this integration, you can generate a secure API key to share with Invision during your insurance application process, which Invision can use to access the report data only.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, obtain the endpoint URL and authentication token.

    1.  Go to **Workflow and Automation → Third-Party Integration**.

    2.  Click **Invision**.

    3.  Click ![](/images/dddna_summary_detection_copy=GUID-4DE35BE5-57A5-4919-BF9C-5EC95F9CA8FD=1=en-us=Low.webp) to copy and save the **Endpoint URL**.

    4.  Copy and save the **Authentication token**.

        - If no authentication token exists, click **Generate** and copy the new token. You can specify the expiration time in **Administration → API Keys**.

        - If the existing authentication token is expired, click **Revoke**, then generate and copy a new token.

2.  Provide the endpoint URL and authentication token to Invision.

    Invision uses these credentials to access report data from Trend Vision One and generate the Invision Insights Report, which helps determine your cyber insurance coverage requirements.

3.  (Optional) If you want to temporarily stop sharing data with Invision, disable the token without permanently revoking access.

    :::note

    Disabling the token immediately blocks Invision's access to the report data in Trend Vision One. You can re-enable the integration at any time.
