# Trend Vision One supports multi-factor authentication for console sign in and critical actions

April 8, 2024—For customers that have updated to the Foundation Services release, Trend Vision One now offers the option to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. With MFA, users are required to provide multiple forms of verification before they can sign in to the console or perform response or IAM actions.

For more information, see [Enable and configure multi-factor authentication](enable-confige-mfa.mdx).
