# Reports

Generate, schedule, and view reports based on security data within your environment.

Create, manage, and schedule reports designed to present an overview of your company's security posture utilizing security data within your environment. Report templates gather information from various Trend Vision One apps and generate reports in formats that are easy to share with stakeholders within your company. Additionally, you can locate the reports manually exported from the Trend Vision One apps.

The following table outlines the tabs on the **Reports** screen (**Dashboards and Reports â†’ Reports**).
