# Running simulations with Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents

Run attack simulation scripts on your endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent.

:::warning[Important]

Simulations only supports running scripts on Windows endpoints.

Enabling **Endpoint detection and response** requires allocating credits. Credits are not required during the trial period. For more information, see [Credit requirements for Trend Vision One solutions, capabilities, and features](credit-req-for-apps-services.mdx).
:::

You can use the attack simulation scripts in the **Resource Center** to test detections and communication with your deployed Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents. Running a simulation requires deploying the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent and enabling Endpoint detection and response.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Deploy the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent on a Windows endpoint.

    If you have not already deployed the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent, see [Deploy agents](deploy-agents.mdx). Read the deployment instructions before installing the agent. Agents might have additional setup requirements needed to ensure the agent can connect to Trend Vision One.

    :::tip

    If this is your first time deploying the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent, or if you only wish to evaluate the capabilities of Trend Vision One, use the **Endpoint Sensor** deployment type.
    :::

    After installation successfully completes, the agent appears in **Endpoint Inventory**. The endpoint list might take a few minutes to update. Refresh your browser to view updated information.

2.  Enable **Endpoint detection and response** on the endpoint.

    If you did not configure a policy for the target endpoint, you can use override settings in Endpoint Inventory to enable **Endpoint detection and response**.

    1.  Go to **Endpoint Security â†’ Endpoint Inventory**.

    2.  Select the target endpoint.

    3.  Click **Endpoint security policy** and select **Override endpoint security policy**.

    4.  Enable **Endpoint detection and response**

    5.  Click **Next** and click **Apply Override**.

3.  Download and run the simulation scripts.

    1.  On the Trend Vision One console, click the **Resource Center** icon (![](/images/resourceCenter=73b1d431-813b-467c-8098-62f12bb6e2af.webp)).

    2.  Click **Simulations**.

    3.  Click **Endpoint Attack**.

        The **Endpoint Attack Simulations** window appears.

    4.  Click the right (![](/images/simulationsRightArrow=20220525102311.webp)) and left (![](/images/simulationsLeftArrow=20220525102211.webp)) arrows to browse available simulations.

    5.  Click **Download Demo Script** to download an archive file.

        :::note

        The archive file is password protected. Copy the password provided in the **Simulations** window.
        :::

    6.  Extract the archive file on the target endpoint.

    7.  Run the `.bat` demo script file on the target endpoint.

        The Windows Command Prompt opens.

    8.  Follow the instructions in the Command Prompt to execute the demonstration commands.

    9.  After executing the commands, access the Trend Vision One console and go to **Workbench** and **Observed Attack Techniques** to view the results.

        :::note

        Results might take a few minutes to appear.
