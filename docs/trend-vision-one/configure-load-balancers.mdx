# Configure load balancers to use multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways as the authentication proxy

Ensure high authentication proxy availability by configuring a load balancer for use with multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways.

When configuring the authentication proxy to be used for Internet Access services, you may choose to use multiple on-premises gateways located behind a load balancer in order to ensure high service availability. The load balancer evenly dispatches authentication requests to the on-premises gateways and adjusts request distribution if one or more on-premises gateways becomes unavailable.

Once a load balancer is deployed and connected to multiple on-premises gateways, you may specify the FQDN or IP address of your load balancer by going to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration → Global Settings** and clicking **Single Sign-On with Active Directory (On-Premises)**. For more information, see [Configuring NTLM or Kerberos single sign-on with Active Directory (on-premises)](ntlm-kerberos-sso-ad.mdx).

:::warning[Important]

This feature only supports layer 4 and layer 7 load balancing.

The following common load balancers can be used to configure multiple on-premises gateways for use as the authentication proxy:

- [Nginx](configuring-nginx.mdx)

- [HAProxy](configuring-haproxy.mdx)

- [F5 BIG-IP LTM](configuring-f5-big-ip.mdx)

- [LVS (Linux Virtual Server)](configuring-lvs.mdx)

- [DNS Round Robin](configure-dns-round-robin.mdx)
