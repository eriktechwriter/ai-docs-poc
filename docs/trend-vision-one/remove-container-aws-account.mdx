# Removing Container Security from your AWS account

You can completely remove Container Security from Amazon AWS accounts if you no longer require protection.

If you no longer want to your Amazon AWS to appear in Container Inventory, you need to update or delete your `Vision-One-Cloud-Account-Management` stack. If you only want to remove Container Security but continue to use your AWS account with other Trend Vision One services, follow the procedure below to properly update your stack.

:::note

Disabling Container Security on a cluster does not delete existing data received by Trend Vision One.
