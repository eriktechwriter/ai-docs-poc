# Can I connect my Alibaba Cloud account to more than one Trend Vision One instance?

Trend Vision One only supports connecting your cloud environments to one Trend Vision One instance at a time. Connecting your Alibaba Cloud account to a second Trend Vision One instance overwrites the resources deployed for the first console.

For example, you connect "Alibaba Account 01" to the Trend Vision One console for your main business, "Company A." Later, you want to connect "Alibaba Account 01" to the Trend Vision One console for your subsidiary, "Company B." Deploying the connection resources from the Trend Vision One console for Company B overwrites the deployed resources from Company A. The connection to "Alibaba Account 01" is then managed by the Trend Vision One console for Company B. The Trend Vision One console for Company A shows a "disconnected" or "unhealthy" status for "Alibaba Account 01."
