# Device posture profiles

:Manage device posture profiles that you can use in secure access rules to allow or deny connections to your corporate resources and access to the internet using certain devices.

A device posture profile specifies a set of security-related criteria, such as the operating system, firewall policy, antivirus software, and disk encryption. A device must meet the criteria to be considered as compliant with your organization's security policies.

:::note

Device posture profiles can be applied to the following:

- Private access rules

- Internet access rules
:::

Trend Vision One provides four default device posture profiles. Each default profile checks only the operating system, regardless of any other device posture criteria. The default profiles cannot be edited or deleted.

:::warning[Important]

To use this feature for device posture validation, make sure you have deployed the Secure Access Module to your users' devices and instructed them to grant required permissions. For more information about the required permissions, see [Secure Access Module system requirements](secure-access-module-sys-reqs.mdx).
