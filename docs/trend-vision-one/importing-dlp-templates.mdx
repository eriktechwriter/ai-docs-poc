# Importing Templates

Use this option if you have a properly-formatted `.dat` file containing the templates. You can generate the file by exporting the templates from either the server you are currently accessing or from another server.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Templates**.

2.  Click **Import** and then locate the `.dat` file containing the templates.

3.  Click **Open**.

    A message appears, informing you if the import was successful. If a template to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
