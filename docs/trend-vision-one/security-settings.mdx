    <li><p><strong>Exclude Microsoft Exchange server folders and files from scans</strong>: Prevents the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent installed on the Microsoft Exchange server from scanning the following Exchange server folders:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The following folders in <code>\Exchsrvr\Mailroot\vsi 1</code>: <code>Queue</code>, <code>PickUp</code>, and <code>BadMail</code></p></li>
    <li><p><code>.\Exchsrvr\mdbdata</code>, including these files: <code>priv1.stm</code>, <code>priv1.edb</code>, <code>pub1.stm</code>, and <code>pub1.edb</code></p></li>
    <li><p><code>.\Exchsrvr\Storage Group</code></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For Microsoft Exchange 2007 or later folders, you need to manually add the folders to the scan exclusion list. For scan exclusion details, see the following website:</p>

    <li><p><strong>Enable deferred scanning on file operations</strong>: Allows users to copy files and then scans the files after the copy process completes to improve the performance of the copy and scan processes</p>


    :::warning[Important]

    <p>Deferred scanning requires that the Virus Scan Engine (VSAPI) be version 9.713 or later.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Enable Early Launch Anti-Malware protection on endpoints</strong>: Allows the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent to load and start scanning before other third-party software drivers during start up (only supported on Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 or later versions)</p>


    :::note

    <p>After scanning all third-party software drivers, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent reports the driver classification information to the system kernel. Administrators can define actions based on the driver classifications in Group Policy in Windows and view scan results using Event Viewer on endpoints.</p>
