# Assignments

Create assignments to apply policies to your endpoint groups.

:::warning[Important]

- Assignments is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the [Pre-Release Disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.mdx) before using the feature.

- This feature is not available in all regions.
:::

**Assignments** provides a central location to create and manage assignments and priorities used for applying policies to your endpoint groups. Assignments contain up to fifteen priorities plus the base priority, allowing you to assign different policies to endpoints within the same group or selection of groups.

There are several actions you can take to manage your assignments.

**Policy actions**
