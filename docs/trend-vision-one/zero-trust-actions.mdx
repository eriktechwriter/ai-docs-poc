# Zero Trust actions

Response actions allow you to directly respond to risks without leaving the Trend Vision One console.

You can take specific actions on users, endpoints, or their app/URL access activity manually or automatically based on risk status. After triggering an action, the **Zero Trust Secure Access** app creates a task and sends the command to the respective enforcement point.

:::note

Actions taken manually take precedence over the automated control configured in secure access rules.
:::

The following tables describe the actions you can take on users, endpoints, internal apps, and cloud apps/URLs found in your environment for risk remediation.
