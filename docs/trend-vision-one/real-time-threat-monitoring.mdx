# Real-Time Posture Monitoring

Trend Vision One™ – Cloud Risk Management Real-Time Posture Monitoring (RTPM) provides live monitoring with instant threat and remediation alerts for activities and events within your [AWS , Azure, and Google Cloud accounts](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-vision-one-real-time-threat-mon).

Cloud Risk Management RTPM ingests raw events to allow you to easily monitor your environment, and supports updating Checks for a subset of Rules in near real-time. You can view our documentation listing the [Cloud Risk Management Rules supported by RTPM](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity-rules).

Real-Time Posture Monitoring offers two *key features*:

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  [Activity Dashboard](activity-dashboard.mdx) - identify unusual user activities

2.  [Monitoring Dashboard](monitoring-dashboard.mdx) - get an in-depth record of all events in an AWS account

### Next steps {#next-steps}

*What's the number of rules RTPM covers once it's enabled?*

- 8 pure RTPM rules, running for any kind of events
- 25+ additional rules looking for events of significance.For example, internet gateway config changes
- 350+ rules running in real-time whenever resources are modified\_

  :::note

  The number of rules covered does not match the\_ [total number of rules](introduction-rules.mdx) that Cloud Risk Management supports. This is because RTPM is set up to cover the most used AWS services. New services or not-so-critical services are not integrated with RTPM
  :::
- The services for which we have extensive but not necessarily complete coverage are:
  - S3
  - EC2
  - ELB
  - Auto Scaling
  - CloudFormation
  - IAM
  - DynamoDB
  - Lambda
  - CloudFront
