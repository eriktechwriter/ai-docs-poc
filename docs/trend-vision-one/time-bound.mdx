# Automated Response Playbooks: time-bound execution, enhanced filtering, and improved email notifications

December 17, 2024—Automated Response Playbooks have been enhanced with several new features. You can now set playbooks to execute automatically only during specified periods, providing greater control over when actions are taken. Additionally, the playbooks offer new options in the **IP address** condition, allowing for more precise filtering of targeted endpoints by including both **Server IP** and **Client IP** options.

Email notifications for manual approval and execution results have also been improved. These notifications now include associated Workbench alert information, giving you more context and details about the actions being taken. This enhancement ensures that you are better informed and can make more timely and accurate decisions.
