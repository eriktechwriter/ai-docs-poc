To learn more, see <a href="trend-vision-one-agentless-vulnerability-threat">Agentless Vulnerability &amp; Threat Detection</a>.</p>
    <p>You can specify which resource types to include in scans when you <a href="trend-vision-one-adding-aws-account">add your AWS account</a> in Cloud Accounts. Three AWS resource types are currently supported: EBS (Elastic Block Store), ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and Lambda. All resources are included in vulnerability scanning by default.
