# Log repositories

Use log repositories to organize and manage your third-party log data according to specified ingestion and retention settings.

Log repositories ingest and retain third-party log data received by connected collectors. You may configure specific ingestion and retention settings for each log repository to efficiently organize your third-party log data. Available ingestion and retention settings include:

- Ingestion types

  - Analytic: Ingests log data for analysis, correlation, and threat hunting

    - Supports both analytic and archival retention

  - Archival: Ingests log data for infrequent queries or to meet compliance requirements

    - Only supports archival retention

  :::warning[Important]

  - To ingest log data, you must allocate credits to Agentic SIEM.

  - You cannot change the ingestion type for a log repository after you create the repository.
  :::

- Retention types:

  - Analytic: Allows for frequent retrieval of log data for analysis, correlation, and threat hunting. Default retention period: 30 days

  - Archival: Stores data for compliance purposes or infrequent queries

  :::note

  Retention of data beyond the default period requires additional credits in Agentic SIEM.
  :::

To ingest log data, you must [add collectors](create-collector.mdx). All connected collectors collect log data according to the log repository ingestion and retention settings. To collect data according to different settings, [create a new log repository](create-log-repository.mdx).
