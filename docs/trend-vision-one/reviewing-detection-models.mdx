# Review detection models

Use the Detection Model Management app to control the types of alerts that Trend Vision One triggers and sends to the Workbench.

By default, Trend Vision One enables alerts for all detection models that your applicable products support. As you add more supported products to your environment, Trend Vision One automatically enables the newly-supported alert triggers.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Detection Model Management**.

2.  Review the currently enabled models or use the filters to locate specific models.

    - **Severity**: Depending on the type of event and MITRE information, the level assigned to the model changes

    - **Applicable products**: Each model requires specific data from supported products

      :::note

      You cannot enable an alert trigger if your environment does not have the required products connected.

    - **Status**: Whether Trend Vision One triggers alerts for the model
