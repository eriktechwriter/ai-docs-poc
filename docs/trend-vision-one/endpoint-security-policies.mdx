# Endpoint Security Policies (unified assignment)

Configure policy settings and assignments to centrally manage endpoint security features.

:::warning[Important]

- If this is your first time using the new Endpoint Security Policies, please read [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx). This version of Endpoint Security Policies is an updated and improved version which integrates most features from Standard Endpoint Protection and Server & Workload Protection. However, support for some features is still under development. Review [Before you enroll](before-you-enroll-policies.mdx) to avoid any potential interruption to your security environment.

  To verify which version of Endpoint Security Policies you are using, look for the **Assignments** and **Policies** tabs. If you do not see the tabs, see [Endpoint Security Policies](sensor-settings-policies.mdx).

**Endpoint Security Policies** allows you to manage Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent features using [Policies](policy-configuration.mdx) and [Assignments](policy-assignments.mdx). Policies offer a unified method for configuring security features from across all agent features including the Endpoint Sensor, Standard Endpoint Protection, and Server & Workload Protection. Use assignments to apply policies to target endpoint groups based on priority criteria.
