# Server certificates

Manage the server certificates of HTTPS web servers.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access Configuration**.

    The **Internet Access Configuration** screen appears.

2.  Select **TLS/SSL Certificates** from the **HTTPS Inspection** drop-down list.

3.  Select **Server certificate** from the **Certificate type** drop-down list in the upper left to view and manage the server certificates added automatically by the system or manually by administrators.

    The list includes the following server certificates:

    - The server certificates that fail in certificate validation.

      The system automatically adds them to the list and sets the default action to **Warn**. When users attempt to access a website using this server certificate, a warning page displays for them to choose whether to continue.

    - The server certificates that you want to configure specific actions for.

4.  You can complete the actions outlined in the following table.
