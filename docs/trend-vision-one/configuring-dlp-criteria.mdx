# Configuring Data Loss Prevention criteria

Cloud Email Gateway Protection evaluates email messages, including their content and attachments, against a set of rules defined in Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. Policies determine files or data that requires protection from unauthorized transmission and the action that Cloud Email Gateway Protection performs after detecting a transmission.

Create DLP policies after you have configured data identifiers and organized them in templates. For details about the data identifiers and templates, see [Data Loss Prevention](data-loss-prevention-email-security.mdx).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Choose a correct path to create your DLP policy for the proper mail traffic direction:

    - **Inbound Protection → Data Loss Prevention → Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy**

    - **Outbound Protection → Data Loss Prevention → Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy**

2.  Click **Add** to add a DLP policy.

3.  Click the **Scanning Criteria** tab.

4.  Select fields to scan, for example, **Subject** and **Body**. To add a customized message header field, select **Other** and specify the field in the text box.

5.  Select at least one compliance templates from the **Available Templates** list and click the right arrow button.
