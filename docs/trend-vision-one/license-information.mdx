<p>Click <img src="./images/simulationsRightArrow=20220525102311.webp" /> to expand a license bundle and view information for the individual licenses within the bundle. Different licenses within a bundle might differ by units, credit conversion rates, and start and expiration dates.</p>


:::note

<p>For <strong>Trend Vision One Credits</strong> licenses, expand the license to view the solutions that your organization intends to allocate credits. The solutions are listed to help you plan your credit usage, but you do not have to allocate credits to those solutions.</p>

<td><p>The number of credits into which the license is automatically converted. For more information on the credit conversion rates for different licenses, see <a href="trend-vision-one-license-calculated-credits">License entitlements calculated into credits</a>.</p>
<p>Trial licenses do not convert to credits.</p>

<td><p><strong>Start date</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The date when the license becomes valid.</p>


:::note

<p>Licenses with start dates in the future appear disabled in <strong>License Information</strong>. Credits converted from licenses that are not yet valid do not count toward your total valid credits until the license start date arrives.</p>

<tr>
<td><p><strong>Expiration date</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The date when the license is no longer valid.</p>


:::note

<p>When a license expires, there might be a grace period, a lock period, or both. During the grace period, you can continue using the solution, but Trend Micro recommends renewing the license as soon as possible. During the lock period, you cannot sign in to the solution without renewing the license, but Trend Micro retains your account data. After your account data is purged from a solution, you can no longer access the data, even if you renew your license.</p>
<p>The result depends on the type of offering:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SaaS solutions: When the license expires, there is a 30-day grace period, followed by a 30-day lock period, after which your data is purged.</p></li>
<li><p>On-premises solutions: When the license expires, there is a grace period, after which updates are no longer applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>Trial licenses: When the license expires, there is a 30-day lock period, after which your data is purged.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For information on the expiration date of your Trend Vision One credits, see <a href="trend-vision-one-accessing-your-console">Trend Vision One access tiers</a>.</p>
