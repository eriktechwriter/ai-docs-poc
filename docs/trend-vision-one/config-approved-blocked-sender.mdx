# Configuring approved and blocked sender lists

:Configure the **Approved Senders** and **Blocked Senders** lists to control which email messages Cloud Email Gateway Protection scans. Specify the senders to allow or block using specific email addresses or entire domains.

:::note

The approved list configured here is available for Cloud Email Gateway Protection only. To configure approved senders that apply across supported Email and Collaboration Security solutions, go to **Configuration and Operations → Policy Resources**.
:::

For example, `*@example.com` specifies all senders from the `example.com` domain.

Evaluation is done in the following order:

1.  Blocked sender list of an end user's email address

2.  Blocked sender list of managed domains or the entire organization

3.  Approved sender list of an end user's email address

4.  Approved sender list of managed domains or the entire organization

:::note

Approved senders of an end user's email address will not override blocked senders for the corresponding domain or organization. For example, assume that `*@example.com` is in the blocked sender list of the administrator console, and `john@example.com` is in the approved sender list of an end user. Messages from `john@example.com` will still be blocked.

IP reputation-based filters use only IP address data to filter messages. You can also use sender email address and domain to filter incoming messages. Approved senders bypass IP reputation-based filtering at the MTA connection level.
:::

Lists of approved or blocked senders are managed using the following tabs on the **Inbound Protection → Connection Filtering → Sender Filter** screen:

- **Approved Senders**

  Cloud Email Gateway Protection performs connection filtering and spam filtering checks on emails from approved senders according to what you specify on the [Sender Filter Settings](sender-filter-settings.mdx) tab.

  Cloud Email Gateway Protection performs virus scanning and content filtering on all emails received and takes the action configured in policy rules once detecting any virus or content filtering violation.

- **Blocked Senders**

  Cloud Email Gateway Protection automatically blocks messages sent from addresses or domains added to the blocked list without submitting the messages to any scanning.

The **Approved Senders** and **Blocked Senders** tables display the following information:

- **Status**: Specifies whether the senders added to a recipient are enabled

- **Recipient**: The recipient for which you approved or blocked the specified sender. The options include the entire organization, a managed domain, or a specific recipient address in a managed domain.

  :::note

  To view the approved or blocked senders added to the **Recipient**, click the recipient name.
  :::

- **Modified**: The date and time that you last modified the senders of the recipient
