 Importing a Keyword List Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .xml file containing the keyword lists. You can generate the file by exporting the keyword lists from the Trend Vision One administrator console. Procedure Go to Administration → Policy Objects → DLP Data Identifiers. Click the Keyword tab. Click Import and then locate the .xml file containing the keyword lists. Click Open. A message appears, informing you if the import was successful. Note Every customized keyword list is identified by its name field in the .xml file. This name is a unique internal name that does not display on the administrator console. If the file contains a customized keyword list that already exists, the existing keyword list is overwritten. If the file contains any predefined keyword list, the predefined keyword list is skipped during the import of the remaining customized keyword lists. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
