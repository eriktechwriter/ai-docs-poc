 Creating One-time Reports Use the One-time Reports screen to generate reports on demand. When creating reports, specify whether to use custom or static templates. Procedure Go to Detections → Reports → One-time Reports. The One-time Reports screen appears. Click Add. The Add One-Time Report > Step 1: Contents screen appears. Type a name for the report in the Name field. (Optional) Type a description for the report in the Description field. In the Report Content section, select one of the following template types: Custom Templates: Select one or more custom report templates. Note Selecting multiple custom templates generates a single report that displays formatted data from all selected templates. For more information about creating custom report templates, see Adding or Editing Custom Templates. Static Templates: Select one or more of the static templates provided by Trend Micro. Select a static template from the Report category drop-down. Select the data to display in the report and specify any corresponding parameters. Select the report generation format. Custom template report formats: Adobe PDF format (*.pdf) HTML format (*.html) XML format (*.xml) CSV format (*.csv) Static template report formats: Adobe PDF format (*.pdf) Microsoft Word format (*.docx) Microsoft Excel format (*.xlsx) Click Next. The Add One-Time Report > Step 2: Targets screen appears. Specify targets using one of the following views. Product Directory: Select the managed products or folders containing the managed products that provide the report information. Tags and filters: Select up to 10 custom tags, filters, or important labels containing the users or endpoints that provide the report information. Note The Tags and filters view is only available for custom report templates. Reports generated by a user account only include data from endpoints that the user account is authorized to view. If a user account selects a tag, filter, or importance label containing endpoints that the user account does not have permission to view, then the generated report excludes data from the unauthorized endpoints. Editing a tag, filter, or importance label on the User/Endpoint Directory screen also modifies the corresponding tag, filter, or importance label used by log queries and reports. For example, if the an endpoint is removed from a custom filter on the User/Endpoint Directory screen, then log queries and generated reports that use the filter will exclude data from the removed endpoint. If the report contains data from a Network VirusWall Enforcer device, specify the clients from which the reports generate: All clients: Generates reports from all Network VirusWall Enforcer devices IP range: Generates reports from a specific IP address range Segment: Generates reports from a specific network segment Click Next. The Add One-Time Report > Step 3: Time Period screen appears. Specify the time period for the report. Click Next. The Add One-Time Report > Step 4: Message Content and Recipients screen appears. (Optional) Email the report as an attachment to selected recipients. In the Subject field, type a title for the email message that contains the report. In the Message field, type a description about the report. Select Email the report as an attachment to send the report to selected recipients. Select contact groups or user accounts. Click >>. The selected contact groups or user accounts appear in the Recipient list. Click Finish. The One-time Reports screen appears and displays the newly added report generation task.
