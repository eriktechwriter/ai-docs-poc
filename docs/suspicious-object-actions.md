/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Suspicious object actions You can specify actions for connected products to take after detecting specific suspicious objects. Trend Vision One connects to different products and sends the Suspicious Object List to the connected products for detection. The connected products then apply the specified action based on their capability. Note Adding IP addresses to the Suspicious Object List does not disrupt the existing connection to the specified endpoints. Only new attempts to connect to the specified endpoints are blocked. The following table outlines the object types and actions supported by different products and applications.
