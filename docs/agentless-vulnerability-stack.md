/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Agentless Vulnerability and Threat Detection stack enhancements June 10, 2024—Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection now includes the following enhancements: The Agentless Vulnerability stack has been split into common and agentless components, which reduces the quantity of IAM roles and policies required. The deployed stack now has two version values, which are tracked separately. To reduce costs, CloudWatch lambda log groups now have ERROR level logging, and scan failures are optimized to reduce unnecessary retry count. Resolved an issue in which CloudWatch log groups could not be deleted after uninstalling. When you upgrade to the new release, the contents of the agentless S3 buckets, including intermediate results, and s3 access logs, will be deleted. This has no impact on any scan results already send to Vision One. For more information, see Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection estimated deployment costs for AWS.
