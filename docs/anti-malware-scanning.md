/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Enable anti-malware scanning for AWS Scan your AWS EBS, ECR, and Lambda resources for malware to help identify threats, prioritize remediation efforts, and secure cloud workloads. Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection provides anti-malware scanning for potential threats, such as viruses, Trojans, and spyware, in your AWS EBS, ECR, and Lambda resources. Anti-malware scanning is not enabled for AWS by default. You may enable the feature at any time in Cloud Accounts for existing AWS accounts or when deploying a new CloudFormation template. If you enable anti-malware scanning on an existing AWS account, scanning begins during the next daily scan. Scan times are not configurable. Procedure Go to Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → AWS and click Add Account. Choose CloudFormation as the deployment method, select Single AWS Account, and click Next. Specify the general information for the account and click Next. For more details, see Adding an AWS account using CloudFormation.The Features and Permissions screen appears. In Features and Permissions, enable Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection and select the deployment regions. Note Selected regions are the regions where Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection is deployed, not necessarily the region of your AWS account. You may select multiple deployment regions. Click Scanner Configuration and enable anti-malware scanning. Select the AWS resource types you wish to include in anti-malware scans. By default, no resource types are selected. Important Enabling anti-malware scanning increases your AWS operational costs. For more information, see Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection estimated deployment costs for AWS. Click Save Changes and continue configuring the CloudFormation template. For AWS accounts that you have already connected in Cloud Accounts: Select the AWS account. Go to the Stack Update tab. In Features and Permissions, enable Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection and follow the configuration steps. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
