/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 1.2.13 - Ensure that the admission control plugin NamespaceLifecycle is set (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 2 - Master Node Reject creating objects in a namespace that is undergoing termination. Setting admission control policy to NamespaceLifecycle ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects. Note By default, NamespaceLifecycle is set. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not include NamespaceLifecycle. Remediation Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml on the Control Plane node and set the --disable-admission-plugins parameter to ensure it does not include NamespaceLifecycle.
