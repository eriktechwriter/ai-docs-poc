 1.1.19 - Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root. Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by root:root. Note By default, the /etc/kubernetes/pki/ directory and all of the files and directories contained within it, are set to be owned by the root user. Audit Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/ Verify that the ownership of all files and directories in this hierarchy is set to root:root. Remediation Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. chown -R root:root /etc/kubernetes/pki/ Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
