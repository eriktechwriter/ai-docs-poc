 Importing Templates Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the templates. You can generate the file by exporting the templates from either the server you are currently accessing or from another server. Procedure Go to Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Templates. Click Import and then locate the .dat file containing the templates. Click Open. A message appears, informing you if the import was successful. If a template to be imported already exists, it will be skipped. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
