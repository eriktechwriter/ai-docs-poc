/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Configure load balancers to use multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways as the authentication proxy Ensure high authentication proxy availability by configuring a load balancer for use with multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways. When configuring the authentication proxy to be used for Internet Access services, you may choose to use multiple on-premises gateways located behind a load balancer in order to ensure high service availability. The load balancer evenly dispatches authentication requests to the on-premises gateways and adjusts request distribution if one or more on-premises gateways becomes unavailable. Once a load balancer is deployed and connected to multiple on-premises gateways, you may specify the FQDN or IP address of your load balancer by going to Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration → Global Settings and clicking Single Sign-On with Active Directory (On-Premises). For more information, see Configuring NTLM or Kerberos single sign-on with Active Directory (on-premises). Important This feature only supports layer 4 and layer 7 load balancing. The following common load balancers can be used to configure multiple on-premises gateways for use as the authentication proxy: Nginx HAProxy F5 BIG-IP LTM LVS (Linux Virtual Server) DNS Round Robin Related information Configuring Nginx as a load balancer for use with multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways Configuring HAProxy as a load balancer for use with multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways Configuring F5 BIG-IP LTM as a load balancer for use with multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways Configuring Linux Virtual Server (LVS) as a load balancer for use with multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways Configuring DNS round-robin mode as a load balancing method for use with multiple Internet Access on-premises gateways © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
