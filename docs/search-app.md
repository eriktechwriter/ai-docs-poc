Construct powerful query strings to pinpoint the data or objects in your environment that you want to examine.

The Search app provides various search methods and filters along with a query language to efficiently identify, categorize, and retrieve search results. You can automate the search process by [saving search queries, configuring the Watchlist](saved-queries.md), and [configuring email notifications](notifications.md) when you find new data.

The following table outlines the actions available in the **Search** app (**XDR Threat Investigation â†’ Search**).
