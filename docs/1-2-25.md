/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 1.2.25 - Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Setup TLS connection on the API server. API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If --client-ca-file argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the client-ca-file is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate. Note By default, --client-ca-file argument is not set. Impact TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for your Kubernetes cluster deployment. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver Verify that the --client-ca-file argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection on the apiserver. Then, edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml on the master node and set the client certificate authority file. --client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file> Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
