/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Adding a custom data loss prevention template Create a custom DLP template for use in secure access rules. Procedure On the Data Loss Prevention Templates screen, click Add. Type a template name that does not exceed 256 characters. Type a description that does not exceed 256 characters. Define a condition statement for this template's data identifiers. Select a data identifier and click Add. If you selected an expression, type the number of occurrences, which is the number of times an expression must occur before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a rule. To manage data identifiers, click Manage Data Identifiers. Choose a logical operator for each definition. Note Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements. Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results. For examples of correct usage, see Condition statements and logical pperators. Click Add to Template. Repeat step 4 to define more condition statements. Choose a logical operator for each condition statement to define the template. Click Save. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
