Create and manage accounts for authorized users to access the Trend Vision One console. Control or limit which screens and apps each account can access by assigning user roles and access levels.

SAML, single sign-on (SSO) accounts use your corporate account credentials to sign on to the Trend Vision One console as well as other services in Trend Vision One that require user authentication. Create an identity provider before creating a SAML account. [Learn more](identity-providers.md).

For more information on asset visibility scopes and permissions, see [User Roles (Foundation Services release)](user-roles-foundation-services.md).
