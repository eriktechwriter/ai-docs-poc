 Merging Reporting Lines You can create a custom reporting line by merging two or more reporting lines. After merging preexisting reporting lines, Trend Micro Apex Central removes the original reporting lines from the list. Tip Trend Micro Apex Central indicates a merged group using a solid dot icon (). Procedure Go to Administration → Settings → Active Directory and Compliance Settings. Click the Reporting Lines tab. Select two or more reporting lines. Click Merge. The Merge Reporting Line screen appears. Specify the Display name that identifies the group on the Security Posture widget/tab. Click Save. After merging reporting lines, you can click Split to split a merged reporting line. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
