 Updated behavior for removed agents reconnecting to Trend Vision One March 25, 2024—After March 25, 2024, endpoints removed from Endpoint Inventory, whether by a user or by the inactive agent removal settings, automatically reconnect when powered on and reappear in the Endpoint Inventory. Endpoints removed before March 25, 2024, do not automatically reconnect.
