/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Delete an outbound static IP pair You can delete an outbound static pair if you want. The generated pair can be recovered and used within 48 hours of the deletion. If you decide to re-use the pair, the region must be the same, but the bandwidth or type of traffic can be changed. If you choose to re-enable outbound static IP settings after 48 hours, you cannot regenerate the original static IP address pair. All traffic forwarding settings are also deleted. Procedure To delete the provisioned static IP address pair, click the delete () icon. Click Save. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
