 Cyber Risk Exposure Management response actions Response actions allow you to directly respond to risks without leaving the Trend Vision One console. You can take specific actions on users, endpoints, or their app/URL access activity manually or automatically based on risk status. After triggering an action, the Zero Trust Secure Access app creates a task and sends the command to the respective enforcement point. Note Actions taken manually take precedence over the automated control configured in secure access rules. The following tables describe the actions you can take on users, endpoints, internal apps, and cloud apps/URLs found in your environment for risk remediation. User Action Description Disable User Account Signs the user out of all active application and browser sessions of the user account. This task might take a few minutes to complete. Users are prevented from signing in any new session. For more information, see Disable User Account task. Enable User Account Allows the user to sign in to new application and browser sessions. This task might take a few minutes to complete. The user's subsequent sign-in attempts and access requests follow the control by secure access rules. For more information, see Enable User Account task. Force Password Reset Signs the user out of all active application and browser sessions, and forces the user to create a new password during the next sign-in attempt. This task might take a few minutes to complete. Note For extra security, require multi-factor authentication (MFA) before allowing users to change passwords. For more information, see Force Password Reset task. Force Sign Out Signs the user out of all active application and browser sessions of the user account. This task might take a few minutes to complete. Users are not prevented from immediately signing back in the closed sessions or signing in new sessions. Note This action is not available for users on your Active Directory (on-premises) or OpenLDAP server. For more information, see Force Sign Out task. Monitor Sign-In Attempt Allows the user to continue with or sign in to new app and browser sessions, monitors and logs all user sign in attempts and browser activity for 24 hours after the rule is triggered, and shows the detection on the Secure Access History screen Endpoint Action Description Isolate Endpoint Disconnects the target endpoint from the network, except for communication with the managing Trend Micro endpoint protection product. For more information, see Isolate Endpoint task. Restore Connection Restores network connectivity to an endpoint that already applied the Isolate Endpoint action.
