 Privilege-based insight visibility August 18, 2025—Trend Vision One now better aligns Workbench insight visibility with user permissions, ensuring security analysts can view the full impact of security incidents while limiting their view of assets that do not fall within their designated management scope. This enhancement refines the investigation experience by ensuring that the presented information is actionable and relevant to the user's role. This alignment is particularly beneficial for multinational organizations. If a security incident spans multiple geographic regions, analysts from each involved SOC can now view the same unified insight to understand the full picture of an attack. This shared context streamlines collaborative investigations, while scope-aware controls ensure teams can only act on the assets for which they are responsible.
