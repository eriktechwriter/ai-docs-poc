 Why can't I view all the VMs in an Azure subscription in Server & Workload Protection? If you connected an Azure subscription using an older method before connection management moved to Cloud Accounts, some virtual machine instances might not appear in Computers or Endpoint Inventory. To resolve the issue, go to Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → Azure and update any legacy connections.
