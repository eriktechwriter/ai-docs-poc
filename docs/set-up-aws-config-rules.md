 Set up AWS Config Rules Server & Workload Protection supports the use of AWS Config Rules to query the status of your AWS instances. This can be especially useful if you want to have a centralized view into whether your instances meet certain compliance requirements. There are four Lambda functions available from the Deep Security AWS Config Rules Repository on GitHub: ds-IsInstanceProtectedByAntiMalware checks whether the current instance is protected by the Server & Workload Protection Anti-Malware module. ds-IsInstanceProtectedBy checks whether the current instance is protected by any of the Server & Workload Protection protection modules. This is a generic version of ds-IsInstanceProtectedByAntiMalware. ds-DoesInstanceHavePolicy checks whether the current instance is protected by a specific Server & Workload Protection policy. ds-IsInstanceClear checks whether the current instance has any warnings, alerts, or errors in Server & Workload Protection.
