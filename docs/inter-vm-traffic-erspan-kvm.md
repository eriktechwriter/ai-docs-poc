Procedure On the Virtual Network Sensor CLI console, type show interface and choose a network interface that shows "Supported" for Encapsulated Remote Mirroring. Execute the enable command. Execute the configure interface <network_interface> command. Execute the ip-encap enable [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] command. Type # exit to return to basic commands and verify that the IP address is shown next to Encapsulated Remote Mirroring. After configuring your network settings, access the Virtual Network Sensor console and use the command show traffic to verify the Virtual Network Sensor is receiving traffic.
