/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Secure Access Module configuration Apply a PAC file to the Secure Access Module in the Trend Vision One console. Procedure In the Trend Vision One console, go to Zero Trust Secure Access → Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access and AI Service Access Configuration, and click the PAC Files tab. Decide the PAC file you want to use. Click in the Applied platform column of the PAC file, and select to apply the PAC file to the Secure Access Module running the desired operating system. The PAC file replacement takes effect within a few minutes. You can also replace the PAC file in the Secure Access Module by individual endpoint or endpoint group in the Secure Access Module screen. For more information, see PAC File replacement. Note For a single endpoint, the PAC file applied by individual endpoint or endpoint group takes effect, regardless of the platform-based PAC file configured for the endpoint. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
