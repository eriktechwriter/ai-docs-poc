Define your network topography and configure settings to manage how network traffic is monitored and scanned.

To provide greater clarity and enhance Trend Vision One network analysis capabilities, Network Security provides key features you can configure to define your network topography and manage how Network Sensors monitor and scan your network traffic.

- **Monitoring / Scanning** provides options to define detection exceptions as well as enable advanced features like packet capture.

- **Network Resources** provides lists you can use to define your network such as critical servers and trusted applications, providing greater detail for Trend Vision One network analysis to determine the source and severity of suspicious behavior.
