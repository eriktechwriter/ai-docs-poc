 Importing Customized Expressions Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the expressions. You can generate the file by exporting the expressions from either the server you are currently accessing or from another server. Procedure Go to Policies → Policy Resources → DLP Data Identifiers. Click the Expression tab. Click Import and then locate the .dat file containing the expressions. Click Open. A message appears, informing you if the import was successful. If an expression to be imported already exists, it will be skipped. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
