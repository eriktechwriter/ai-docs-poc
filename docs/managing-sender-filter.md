Blocked senders Specifies the senders to block using specific email addresses or entire domains. Sender filter settings Specifies the type of sender addresses collected to match the approved and blocked sender lists. Specifies whether to insert an X-Header in the message header for email messages matching approved senders. Specifies whether to skip certain security checks on email messages from approved senders. Cloud Email Gateway Protection achieves a two-way synchronization between the following data: Senders configured for a specific end user on the administrator console Senders added by that user through the End User Console or quarantine digest notifications Any changes made to the approved or blocked senders of an end user either on the administrator console or End User Console should be reflected to the other location.
