Manage access permissions to your Google Cloud Identity data for use in Trend Vision One apps.

The **Google Cloud Identity** screen (**Workflow and Automation â†’ Third-Party Integration**) provides an overview of permissions that Trend Vision One apps require to access data or trigger policy enforcement actions in Google Cloud Identity. Each app or group of apps is associated with a set of permissions that must be enabled within Google Cloud Identity to facilitate integration with Trend Vision One.

The following table describes the actions available in the **Google Cloud Identity** screen.
