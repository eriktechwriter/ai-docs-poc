/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ About mx records and Cloud Email Gateway Protection Important Make sure the MX record is entered exactly as provided in the Cloud Email Gateway Protection welcome email message. An MX record (DNS mail exchanger host record) determines the message routing for all messages sent to a domain. To route messages destined for your domain through the Cloud Email Gateway Protection MTA, you must point your MX record to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) provided in the welcome email message that Trend Micro sent you after you registered. To disable Cloud Email Gateway Protection, point your MX record to route all inbound SMTP traffic to your own mail server. If you are unsure how to configure the MX records for your domain, contact your Internet Service Provider or your DNS technician.
