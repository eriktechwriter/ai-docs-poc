After TMAS is integrated into your continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery (CD) pipeline, you can view the scan results of registry image artifacts for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets in Cloud Security → Container Security → Log → Container Image Scanning. Learn more about TMAS. Only the following artifacts are displayed in Container Image Scanning: registry docker podman docker-archive oci-archive oci-dir singularity The Container Security does not display dir and file artifacts.
