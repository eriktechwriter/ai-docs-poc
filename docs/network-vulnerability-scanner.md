 Network Vulnerability Scanner Conduct agentless scanning of your network for fast visibility into your organization's network infrastructure and vulnerabilities. Important This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-release disclaimer before using the feature. Network Vulnerability Scanner allows you to systematically discover network assets, identify potential security weaknesses in network devices, and detect misconfigurations in your internet-facing assets to safeguard against cyber threats and ensure the integrity of your organization’s infrastructure. No agent deployment is required. You can create individual scan configurations based on templates and set the scans to run on a predetermined schedule or trigger scans manually. Network Vulnerability Scanner requires an up-to-date Service Gateway virtual appliance with version 1.1.0 or later of the Network Vulnerability Scanner service installed. When configuring a new scan in Scan Templates or by clicking Create scan in Network scans, you may choose the Service Gateway to use for the specified scan. Only Service Gateways with the Network Vulnerability Scanner service installed are able to run scans. A single Service Gateway can run up to a maximum of 15 concurrent scans. Tip To request more templates, click Need more templates? in Scan templates and provide your feedback. After a scan completes, you can download the scan report from the Scan Reports tab to view discovered devices and detected vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Discovered devices appear in Attack Surface Discovery. Detected vulnerabilities and system configuration events appear in Threat and Exposure Management and Cyber Risk Overview. Important For all scan templates, Network Vulnerability Scanner only uses a single IP address to scan and report results for any supplied FQDN that resolves to multiple IP addresses.
