/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Focus your search using sub-folders Create sub-folders within your smart folders to narrow your searches. Note To automatically create sub-folders for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, see Automatically create sub-folders. You can use sub-folders to filter a smart folder's search results. Smart folders can be nested up to 10 levels deep. For example, you might have a smart folder for all your Windows computers, but want to focus on computers that are specifically Windows 7, and maybe specifically either 32-bit or 64-bit. To do this, under the Windows parent folder, you could create a child smart folder for Windows 7. Then, under the Windows 7 folder, you would create two child smart folders: 32-bit and 64-bit. Procedure Right-click a smart folder and select Create Child Smart Folder. Edit your child smart folder's query groups or rules. Click Save. Click your new smart folder. Verify that it contains all expected computers. Also verify that it omits computers that shouldn't match the query. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
