Use the email activation link to activate Trend Vision One with Advanced Access.

Trend Micro provisions a Trend Vision One console with a complete suite of apps to customers with Trend Vision One credits. Certain features within your Advanced Access entitlement require the allocation of credits. The expiration date of the console aligns with the expiration date of your credits.
