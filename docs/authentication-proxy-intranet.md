Internet access on-premises gateway authentication proxy using Kerberos authentication Internet access on-premises gateway authentication Proxy using NTLM authentication The authentication proxy service on the Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access On-Premises Gateway facilitates NTLM v2 or Kerberos-supported single sign-on (SSO) authentication with your on-premises Active Directory server. The service retrieves settings and data from Trend Vision One via HTTPS through port 443 on firewall A. Once configured, the authentication proxy service allows end users to reach your Active Directory server from endpoints under the following scenarios. Secure Access Module status Location Connection method Installed Corporate network Any method Not installed Corporate network Through a configured Internet Access On-Premises Gateway or through the Internet Access Cloud Gateway from a defined IP address Before configuring the authentication proxy service, you must have a Service Gateway virtual appliance installed with the Zero Trust Secure Access Internet Access On-Premises Gateway service enabled. Procedure In Secure Access Configuration → Internet Access Configuration → Global Settings, enable Single Sign-On with Active Directory (On-Premises) and complete the configuration steps. Ensure that DNS can resolve the FQDN of the authentication proxy with the proper IP address for endpoints accessing from the corporate network.
