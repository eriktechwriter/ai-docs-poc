 XDR detections for Gen-AI applications in Amazon Bedrock August 21, 2024—XDR for Cloud now provides monitoring capabilities for detecting possible attacks on Gen-AI applications in Amazon Bedrock. XDR for Cloud monitors for attempted and unauthorized deletion of guardrails and knowledge bases, and tampering with logging. These detections require the XDR for Cloud - AWS CloudTrail feature to be enabled on your connected AWS accounts. If you have already enabled the feature, the new detection capabilities are enabled by default. To enable XDR for Cloud - AWS CloudTrail, go to Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → AWS and update the deployment stack. To view the new detection models, go to Agentic SIEM & XDR → Detection Model Management. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
