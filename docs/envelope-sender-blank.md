 Using envelope sender is blank criteria Spoofing messages often have envelope senders (specified by the envelope field "MAIL FROM") set to blank to evade sender verification. Cloud Email Gateway Protection allows you to scan messages for empty envelope senders to help you combat spoofing. Note Some normal messages may also have empty envelope senders, such as bounce messages or notification messages. Selecting this criteria will affect these messages. This criteria is available for inbound protection only. Procedure On the Scanning Criteria tab, click Advanced. Select Envelope sender is blank. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
