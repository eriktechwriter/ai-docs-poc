/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Updating the add-in for Outlook The Add-in for Outlook automatically updates when a new version with minor changes is available. A manual update is required only when major changes are available, for which Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection will make announcements. Note The version number of the Add-in for Outlook is in the format major.minor.revision, such as 1.0.0. The major number reflects major changes, while the minor and revision numbers reflect minor changes. Manual update is necessary when the major number changes. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, the version number of the Add-in for Outlook changes only after a manual update, so it can be different from the add-in version number in Outlook. Procedure In Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection, go to Administration → Add-in for Outlook, and copy the Link to manifest file. Log on to the Microsoft 365 admin center with your Global Administrator account. Go to Settings → Integrated apps. Locate and click Cloud App Security Add-in. On the Cloud App Security Add-in screen, click Update app under Actions. On the Update file screen, click Provide link to manifest file, paste the link you copied in step 1, and click Validate. Wait until the validation is completed and click Next. Click Accept and update and click Done. According to Microsoft, it can take up to 72 hours for the update of an add-in to apply at your users' side. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
