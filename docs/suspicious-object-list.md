/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Suspicious Object List Trend Vision One consolidates suspicious object information from different sources. A suspicious object is a known malicious or potentially malicious domain, file SHA-1, file SHA-256, IP address, sender address, or URL. You can add suspicious objects to the Suspicious Object List manually or though extraction from third-party intelligence. In addition, Sandbox Analysis adds suspicious objects to the list after determining possible threats for consolidation and synchronization. Sandbox Analysis then assigns risk level based on analysis results. Trend Vision One can also connect to different products and send the Suspicious Object List to the connected products for detection. The connected products then apply the specified actions from Suspicious Object Management. Note For suspicious objects added manually or through third-party intelligence, the maximum limit is 10,000 for each object type. For suspicious objects added by Sandbox Analysis, the maximum limit is 25,000 for each object type. When the maximum number of suspicious objects is exceeded, the objects that are closest to expiration are removed. The following table outlines the actions available on the Suspicious Object List tab.
