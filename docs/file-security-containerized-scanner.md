/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ File Security Containerized Scanner The File Security Containerized Scanner is a flexible scanning solution installed on a Kubernetes cluster that is installed behind. It can be used for protecting your file storage system or scanning your files/application scanner. The File Security Containerized Scanner is a local scanner behind your firewall. You can use it scan your file storage, cloud storage, network file system, and CI/CD pipeline. You can then use one of File Security's SDK or CLI to access the scanner or to integrate your own file connector. Your files never leave your system; only metadata is returned to Trend Micro. You create your Kubernetes cluster and then install our helm chart on the cluster. Since it is installed on a Kubernetes cluster, you can easily add more clusters if you need to add more scanners.
