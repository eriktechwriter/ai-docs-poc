Define an asset group to assign an Asset group tag value to the group's assets.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **Asset Group Management** screen, click **Get started** to create your first asset group.

    The node labeled **Your organization** appears.

    :::note
    You can create a maximum of 30 asset groups in up to two layers under your organization. The organization node does not count towards the maximum.
    :::

2.  Hover over the organization node and click the ![](/images/add_icon=cf892c2f-1a1f-4d22-848f-023067e4a507.webp) icon to add an asset group.

    An empty asset group appears under the organization node.

    The **Asset Group Settings** window appears.

3.  Configure the settings for the asset group.

    1.  Type a **Name** for the asset group.

        :::note
        Asset group names have a maximum length of 256 characters, and cannot have initial or final spaces.
        :::

    2.  Assign an Asset group tag value to the assets in the group.

        - Select an existing value of the Asset group tag: Select a tag value from the drop-down list.

          :::note
          Tag values must be unique. You can only select tag values that are not already in use in another asset group.
          :::

        - Add a new value for the Asset group tag: Type a value in the field and click **+ Add "\[Tag value name\]"**.

          :::note
          You can create a maximum of 30 values for the Asset group tag. Once you have added 30, you can only modify existing tag values, or delete tag values to create new ones.

          Tag values have a maximum length of 64 characters, and cannot have initial or final spaces. Only letters, numbers, spaces, and the following special characters are supported: .@:+=\_/-
          :::

    3.  Specify a name or email address for the **Group owner**.

    4.  Type a **Description** of the asset group.

    5.  Click **Save**.

    The new asset group appears in your organizational structure.

4.  To edit an existing asset group, hover over the new asset group and click the ![](/images/edit_icon=GUID-1F1D1164-5310-4D6D-ACD0-6049C86960AF.webp) icon.

5.  To delete an asset group, hover over the group and click the ![](/images/trash_icon=GUID-47cf6867-6315-438e-8670-86ff36f22a28.webp) icon, then click **Delete** in the confirmation window.

    The selected asset group and any child asset groups are deleted, though individual assets retain their assigned Asset group tag values.
