 Connecting Alibaba Cloud accounts Add your Alibaba Cloud accounts to provide visibility into your cloud environment. Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with sufficient privileges for the account you wish to connect. For best results, sign into the account on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. Review the region limitations to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources. Once you are ready, connect your Alibaba Cloud account.
