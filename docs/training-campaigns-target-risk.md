/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Create Security Awareness Training training campaigns targeting at-risk users Important This is a "Pre-release" feature and is not considered an official release. Please review the Pre-release disclaimer before using the feature. January 15, 2024—In addition to manually creating training campaigns for your users in the Security Awareness Training app, you can now also initiate campaigns from the Attack Surface Discovery, Threat and Exposure Management, and Identity Posture apps. Campaigns initiated from these three apps enable you to provide Security Awareness Training training focused specifically on at-risk users. When viewing domain accounts in Attack Surface Discovery, the context menu now includes the Create Training Campaign option. In Threat and Exposure Management, the remediation steps for some types of risk events—such as phishing simulations indicating user accounts might be vulnerable to attack — now include links to create Security Awareness Training training. The Identity Posture app's Identity Summary screen for highly privileged identities and the highlighted exposure risk events in the Exposure tab now also feature a Create Security Awareness Training Training Campaign button.
