 Enhanced virus scan capability to detect .alz and .egg archive files July 21, 2025—Cloud Email Gateway Protection supports detection of .alz and .egg compressed files in both inbound and outbound email traffic. Once extracted, file contents are scanned by the Advanced Threat Scan Engine (ATSE) and Virtual Analyzer (if enabled) according to the configured virus policy rules. Additionally, for inbound emails, if File Password Analysis is enabled, encrypted .alz and .egg files will be decrypted using the retrieved password, then scanned by ATSE and Virtual Analyzer (if enabled), ensuring comprehensive protection against hidden threats.
