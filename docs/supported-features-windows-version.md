Supports only the Quarantine action. Supports continuous real-time scanning. Deep Security Agent for macOS (version 20.0.158+) does not support the Schedule option for real-time scans (Anti-Malware → General → Real-Time Scan). Because embedded operating systems usually run on custom hardware (for example, on point-of-sale terminals), you should thoroughly test your specific hardware platform prior to deployment in a production environment. Trend Micro tests Windows Embedded platforms in a virtualized environment. If you need to raise a case with Trend Micro Support, try to reproduce the problem in a virtualized environment. If the issue cannot be reproduced in a virtualized environment, and is specific to your custom hardware, Trend Micro Support might require you to provide remote access to it for diagnostics. Note Windows 10 IoT was formerly named Windows 10 Embedded, and is therefore considered a Windows Embedded platform. Requires a Full/Desktop Experience installation. Server Core is not supported. Anti-Malware on-demand scans are supported on all Solaris file systems.
