/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Backup Files Files with the RB0~RB9 extensions are backup copies of infected files. The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent creates a backup of the infected file in case the virus/malware damaged the file during the cleaning process. Solution: If the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent successfully cleans the infected file, you do not need to keep the backup copy. If the endpoint functions normally, you can delete the backup file. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
