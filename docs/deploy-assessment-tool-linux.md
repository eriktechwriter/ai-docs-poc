 Deploying the assessment tool to Linux endpoints Deploy the assessment tool to scan Linux endpoints for vulnerable versions of the Log4j library or Samba service. The tool supports the following platforms. Platform Memory Disk Space Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Amazon Linux (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Amazon Linux 2 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended CentOS Linux 6 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended CentOS Linux 7 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended CentOS Linux 8 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Ubuntu 16 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Ubuntu 18 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Ubuntu 20 (64-bit) 2 GB minimum 5 GB recommended 1 GB recommended Endpoints must be connected to the internet so the tool can upload data to the Trend Vision One. Trend Micro recommends adding the following URLs and ports to the safe list. Region URL Port Australia api-ap4.xbc.trendmicro.com 443 https://assessment-ap4.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 https://release-us1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 Europe api-eu1.xbc.trendmicro.com 443 https://assessment-eu1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 https://release-us1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 India api-ap5.xbc.trendmicro.com 443 https://assessment-ap5.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 https://release-us1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 Japan api-ap2.xbc.trendmicro.com 443 https://assessment-ap2.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 https://release-us1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 Singapore api-ap3.xbc.trendmicro.com 443 https://assessment-ap3.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 https://release-us1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 United States https://api-us1.xbc.trendmicro.com 443 https://assessment-us1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 https://release-us1.mgcp.trendmicro.com 443 The assessment report provides details about endpoints and server applications that may be affected by the vulnerability. You will also receive information about actions that you can take to mitigate risk and expand your view of the attack surface. Procedure In the Identify servers affected by the Samba Vulnerability (CVE-2021-44142) area, click Start Assessment or choose Log4Shell vulnerability from Scan for More Attack Campaigns. Click Download Assessment Tool. Follow the on-screen instructions to download the installation package. Extract the installation package by executing the following command: tar zxf tmxbc_linux64.tgz Install the Endpoint Basecamp program.
