 Using attachment mime content type criteria The Attachment is MIME content type criteria allows you to create policy rules that take actions on messages based on the MIME content-type of attachments a message contains. Note Where the Attachment is MIME content type criteria makes decisions based on the MIME content-type indicated, the Attachment is true file type criteria scans the headers of the actual attached files themselves for the identifying signatures. Procedure On the Scanning Criteria tab, click Advanced. Select the Attachment is MIME content type criteria. Click the MIME content type link. The Attachment MIME Content Type screen appears. From the drop-down list, select Selected MIME content types or Not selected MIME content types. Select the MIME content types for Cloud Email Gateway Protection to match on. If you want to block attachments by explicit MIME content types, type the names of the MIME content types to block, under the Other MIME content types text field.
