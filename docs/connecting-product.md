Use the Product Connector app to manage and register additional products and services to Trend Vision One.

Depending on how you obtained your license, Trend Vision One may have automatically registered your related services to the Trend Vision One console. For example, if you purchased a license that included Apex One as a Service and Cloud App Security, these services should already appear in the Product Connector app.

:::warning[Important]
Connecting a product to Trend Vision One does not guarantee that the target products can send the necessary data to the Trend Micro data lakes. You must configure specific features or policies on the related product console to facilitate the transfer of data.

Ensure that you provision the consoles of your other products before attempting to connect to Trend Vision One.

For detailed instructions about how to properly register and configure specific products, see [Required settings on supported products](req-setting-supported-product.md).
