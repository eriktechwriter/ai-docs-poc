/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Oracle supported regions and limitations Supported regions and deployment limitations for connecting your Oracle compartments. Some Cloud Account features have limited support for Oracle compartments. The list of supported regions might change as development of support for additional regions continues. Review the information below before connecting your Oracle compartment to avoid any confusion or service interruption. Note Oracle Cloud regions are grouped into realms, and tenancy exists in a single realm that can access all regions under this realm. Trend Vision One supports the default OCI commercial realm, which has the realm key "OC1". All of the regions listed in the table below are included in the default OCI commercial realm. For more information about realms, see the Oracle Cloud documentation.
