title: Automatic disabling of Activity Monitoring after updating to Server & Workload Protection
---

After updating from Trend Cloud One Endpoint & Workload Security, your endpoint agents update to the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent with Server & Workload Protection features. If you enable Endpoint sensor detection & response, the agent automatically disables Activity Monitoring.

To prevent your agents from disabling Activity Monitoring when updating to the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent, ensure the Endpoint detection & response setting is disabled in the **Default Endpoint Policy**. For more information about configuring endpoint security policies, see [Configuring endpoint security policies](configuring-endpoint-policies.md).
