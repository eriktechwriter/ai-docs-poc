/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Event Rule Management View and manage event rules for risk events marked as Dismissed or Accepted. The Event Rule Management screen provides a centralized location to view and manage event rules. You may create event rules when changing the status of risk events and vulnerabilities. Statuses that support rule creation include: Dismissed: Marking a risk event as Dismissed and creating a related event rule prevents the reporting of future instances of the risk event, keeping them from affecting the Cyber Risk Index. Accepted: Marking a risk event as Accepted and creating a related event rule ensures existing and future instances of the risk event are marked as Accepted for the specified time period. Events marked as Accepted still contribute to your Cyber Risk Index. Removing an event rule enables reporting for future instances of the related risk event. The following table outlines the actions available on the Event Rule Management screen. Action Description Filter event rules Use the drop-down menus and Search field to locate specific event rules. Group by: Group event rules by the original Risk event or by Assets Risk factor: Filter event rules by the risk factor of the original risk event The Risk factor drop-down menu is only available when viewing event rules grouped by Risk event. Impacted assets: Filter event rules by the type of asset impacted by the original risk event The Impacted assets drop-down menu is only available when viewing event rules grouped by Risk event. Asset type: Filter event rules by the type of asset The Asset type drop-down menu is only available when viewing event rules grouped by Assets.
