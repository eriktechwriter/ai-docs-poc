 Connecting and updating Trend Micro Email Security Important Permanent Update: After starting the update, you cannot stop the process or revert back to the previous system state, and you will no longer be able to access your Trend Micro Email Security console. Updating your product automatically transfers all license information and relevant product data to Trend Vision One. Automatic Credit Conversion and Allocation: The update will convert your Trend Micro Email Security license to an equivalent value in Trend Vision One credits and allocate credits to the Cloud Email Gateway Protection app. You can view your credit balance and allocation from Credits & Billing in Trend Vision One. For more information, see License entitlements calculated into credits. For customers with a Trend Micro Email Security Standard license, extra credits will be automatically allocated to the Email Encryption feature for you to continue using this advanced feature after the update. The allocated credits also entitle you to other advanced features in Cloud Email Gateway Protection. Feature Differences: A few features in Trend Micro Email Security are currently not available or moved to a different location after the update. For more information, see Feature differences and limitations between Trend Micro Email Security and Cloud Email Gateway Protection. Compliance Considerations: Check the Trend Vision One data privacy, security, and compliance disclosures to understand how the update affects your Trend Vision One system. Forced Sign Out During Update: After starting the update, your consoles become temporarily inaccessible and any active users are automatically signed out of the system. After the update is complete, you may need to update your user accounts in order to continue using the system. Post-Update Tasks: After the update is completed, we recommend that you verify that your product instances are properly configured and that your users have the correct access rights. For more information, see Post update tasks for Trend Vision One Email and Collaboration Security. Procedure Sign in to the Trend Vision One console.
