 Process information Learn about the types of evidence in the process information category that Forensics might collect from Linux endpoints. Primary evidence collected on running processes Forensics displays primary process information a table after selecting Running Processes in the evidence report. Evidence Data Description User name The user names associated with the process PID The process ID Command line The command line used to execute the process Creation time The time the process was started Parent PID The process ID of the parent process SHA1 The secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1) of the associated file Kernel time The amount of time spent in kernel mode in ticks User time The amount of time spent in user mode in ticks Detailed process information Important Your system might not collect and display all listed metadata. Primary evidence collected on running processes Forensics displays detailed process information in columns after selecting an evidence category when examining an Evidence Report. Evidence Data Description User name The user names associated with the process PID The process ID Command line The command line used to execute the process Creation time The time the process was started Parent PID The process ID of the parent process SHA1 The secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1) of the associated file Kernel time The amount of time spent in kernel mode in ticks User time The amount of time spent in user mode in ticks File information See Shared File Info Objects Socket connections Evidence Data Description Local address The associated local internet protocol (IP) address Local port The associated local transmission control protocol / user datagram protocol (TCP)/(UDP) port number Protocol The associated transmission control protocol Remote address The associated remote IP address Remote port The associated remote TCP/UDP port number State The state of the connection Creator UID The user ID of the socket creator Associated threads Evidence Data Description Thread ID The process ID of the thread Command line The file name of the executable file or the command name associated with the thread Current state The current state of the process expressed as a representative character Parent PID The process ID of the parent process Process group ID The group ID associated with the process Session ID The session ID of the process Controlling terminal process group ID The ID of the foreground process group in the controlling terminal User time The amount of time spent in user mode in ticks Kernel time The amount of time spent in kernel mode in ticks Priority The priority value of the process Nice value The value used to set the true process priority Start time The running time of the process in ticks Virtual memory (bytes) The amount of virtual memory used in bytes Waiting channel The kernel address of the process when sleeping Real-time priority value The priority value used for real-time processes Exit code The value representing the exit status of the thread Accessible libraries See Shared File Info Objects Opened files See Shared File Info Objects Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
