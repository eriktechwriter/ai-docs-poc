 Cache Settings for Scans The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent can build the digital signature and on-demand scan cache files to improve its scan performance. When an on-demand scan runs, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent first checks the digital signature cache file and then the on-demand scan cache file for files to exclude from the scan. Scanning time is reduced if a large number of files are excluded from the scan. Related information Digital Signature Cache On-demand Scan Cache Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
