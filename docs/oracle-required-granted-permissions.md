 Oracle required and granted permissions Review the permissions required to deploy resources and the permissions granted during the terraform process. The terraform process assigns certain permissions to itself to establish the connection with Cloud Accounts and Trend Vision One cloud security services. These permissions include enabling the Cloud Accounts app and security services to obtain temporary credentials and complete tasks within your Oracle cloud environment.
