The algorithm now places a greater importance on Attack Detection. Periodic algorithm updates are part of our continuous effort to optimize the risk algorithm to provide you with an accurate, timely, and actionable Risk Index. Important Algorithm updates can result in a sudden and significant increase to asset risk scores and the Risk Index. A sharp increase in the Risk Index that directly coincides with an algorithm update can be considered the result of the algorithm change. For more details, see Cyber Risk Index algorithm updates.
