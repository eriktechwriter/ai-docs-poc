/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ 1.2.8 - Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Turn on Role Based Access Control. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode. Note By default, RBAC authorization is not enabled. Impact When RBAC is enabled you will need to ensure that appropriate RBAC settings (including Roles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings) are configured to allow appropriate access. Audit Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver Verify that the --authorization-mode argument exists and is set to a value to include RBAC. Remediation Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml on the Control Plane node and set the --authorization-mode parameter to a value that includes RBAC, for example: --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
