The expiration date of the Trend Vision One console aligns with the expiration date of the supported license that expires last. After expiration, there is a 30-day lock period during which you are not able to access the Trend Vision One console through browser or API. All data is deleted after the lock period. Renew your license or credits before the end of the lock period to retain your data.

:::note
If your credits for [Advanced Access](advanced-access.md) expire and you still hold a valid license for [Essential Access](essential-access.md), you can continue using Essential Access apps and features until the associated license expires.
