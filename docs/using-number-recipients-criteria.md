 Using the number of recipients criteria The Recipient Number criteria allows you to create policy rules that take actions on messages based on the number of recipients the message is addressed to. Procedure On the Scanning Criteria tab, click Advanced. Select Any Match. The Attachment is password protected, Attachment contains active content, and Recipient number criteria become available. Select Recipient number. Select > or <= from the comparison drop-down list. Select > to apply the policy rule to messages that are sent to more than the specified number of recipients. Select <= to apply the policy rule to messages that have the same number or fewer than the specified number of recipients. For example: > 10 applies the policy rule to all messages that have more than 10 recipients. <= 10 applies the policy rule to all messages that have 10 or fewer recipients. Type a value for the number of recipients. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
