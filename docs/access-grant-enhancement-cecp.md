 Access grant enhancement to OneDrive, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Teams in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection July 19, 2024 – For OneDrive, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Teams, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection enhances the access grant process to remove dependency on Azure Communication Services, which is scheduled to retire in the future. When granting access to the above-mentioned services, administrators do not need to manually grant Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection permissions to receive notifications from Microsoft upon any change to the files on these services.
