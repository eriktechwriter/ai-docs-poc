/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Real-time Scan Real-time Scan is a persistent and ongoing scan. Each time a file is received, opened, downloaded, copied, or modified, Real-time Scan scans the file for security risks. If Apex One (Mac) does not detect a security risk, the file remains in its location and users can proceed to access the file. If Apex One (Mac) detects a security risk, it displays a notification message, showing the name of the infected file and the specific security risk. Configure and apply Real-time Scan settings to one or several agents and groups, or to all Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents that the server manages.
