 1.1.4 - Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file ownership is set to root:root (Automated) Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file ownership is set to root:root. The controller manager pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of various components of the master node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Note By default, kube-controller-manager.yaml file ownership is set to root:root. Audit Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml Verify that the ownership is set to root:root. Remediation Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
