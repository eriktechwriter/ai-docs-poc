/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Endpoint Security Policy feature support requirements Review which protection features are supported by deployment type and operating system. Important Endpoint security policies (unified assignment) only support endpoints with the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent version 202507 release or later installed. Some endpoint protection features do not support all agent deployments or operating systems. If you apply a policy with protection features enabled to an unsupported endpoint, the agent treats the setting as disabled and shows the disabled status in Endpoint Inventory. Operating System support by Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent deployment Operating System Standard Endpoint Protection Server & Workload Protection Endpoint Sensor only Windows Yes Yes Yes Linux No Yes Yes macOS Yes Limited: see note Yes Important The Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent does not support deploying the Server & Workload Protection agent configuration to macOS. However, Server & Workload Protection does support managing macOS endpoints with the Trend Cloud One or Deep Security agent installed and can deploy the Endpoint Sensor to the endpoint. Endpoint Security Policies can only manage Endpoint Sensor related features on macOS endpoints managed using Server & Workload Protection.
