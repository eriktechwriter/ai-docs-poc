 Getting started with Cloud Accounts Set up the Cloud Accounts app and connect your cloud assets to Trend Vision One. If this is your first time using the Cloud Accounts app, and you would like to know more about the XDR for Cloud feature, see About XDR for Cloud. To start connecting your cloud accounts, open a new browser tab and access the account you wish to connect using a sign-in or user role with administrator privileges. Then, follow the guide for your cloud provider: To connect new AWS accounts or update legacy connections, see Connecting and updating AWS accounts. To connect new Azure subscriptions or update legacy connections, see Connecting and updating Azure subscriptions. To connect Google Cloud projects, see Connecting Google Cloud projects. To connect Alibaba Cloud accounts, see Connecting Alibaba Cloud accounts. Note Legacy connections are cloud accounts imported from other apps such as Server & Workload Protection or Cloud Risk Management either when updating connected Trend Micro products or as features are centralized.
