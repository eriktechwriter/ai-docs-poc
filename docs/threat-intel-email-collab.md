/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Threat Intelligence Trend Vision One consolidates suspicious object information based on input from different sources and synchronizes the suspicious objects with integrated products. Once integrated, Cloud Email Gateway Protection automatically synchronizes suspicious URLs, file SHA-1 hashes, and file SHA-256 hashes from Trend Vision One upon integration and later whenever these types of suspicious objects are updated. In addition to its own mechanism, Cloud Email Gateway Protection can leverage the suspicious objects to detect known or potentially malicious files, URLs, and sender addresses during scanning. For more information about how Trend Vision One manages suspicious objects, see the "Threat Intelligence" > "Suspicious Object Management" in Trend Vision One Online Help.
