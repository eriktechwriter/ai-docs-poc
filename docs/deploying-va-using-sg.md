 Deploy a Virtual Appliance from the Service Gateway page You deploy the Trend Micro File Security Virtual Appliance behind your firewall using the Trend Vision One Service Gateway. You need to deploy your service gateway before starting. If you have not deployed a service gateway, see Deployment guides. Although you can add the File Security Virtual Appliance on a service gateway containing other services, Trend Micro recommends that you have a dedicated serviced gateway for File Security Virtual Appliance. When you add the File Security Virtual Appliance to your Service Gateway, the Service Gateway appears on the File Security Inventory page. Virtual appliances can have multiple servers, and servers can have multiple mount points. From this page you can add, modify, remove, or turn off servers and mount points for a specific Virtual Appliance. Virtual Appliance can be used with the following file systems: NFS3, NFS4 SMB 3.0, SMB 3.1 Note SMB requires Service Gateway 3.0.19 or higher.
