/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Access Policy View conditional access (CA) policies used by your organization, including status and the identities to which the policies are assigned. The Access Policy tab allows you to view the CA policies used in your organization and applied to registered identities. CA policies are if-then statements in which an assigned identity meets one or more conditions, such as enabling multi-factor authentication, in order to trigger an action, such as allowing full access to an application or network. The following table details the columns on the Access Policy tab. Column name Description Access policy name Name of a CA policy. Status Status of a CA policy. Report only policies are used for testing purposes. Assignments Users, groups, and roles that are assigned to a CA policy. Click the number next to the related icon to view a list of users, groups, or roles assigned to the policy. Important All roles assigned to a CA policy are displayed, even if the role is not currently held by a user, group, or role. If the role is not currently held, selecting the role will not return any data from the Roles tab. Access controls Access controls that must be fulfilled to pass a CA policy. Last modified time Last time when a CA policy was modified. Â© 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
