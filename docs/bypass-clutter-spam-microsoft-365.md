/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Bypass clutter and spam filtering by email header for phishing simulation emails in Microsoft 365 Create rules in Microsoft 365 to allow phishing simulation emails to bypass your organization's clutter and spam filters. To ensure Microsoft 365 users can receive phishing simulation emails, you can configure rules to allow emails to bypass clutter and spam filtering using keys contained in the email header. Note These instructions were valid for Microsoft 365 Exchange as of January 25, 2025. Procedure Get the required header key and value from the Trend Vision One console. In the Trend Vision One console, go to Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Security Awareness → Phishing Simulations. Click the settings icon (). In Allow List Settings, copy the header key and value. Create a new transport rule for Microsoft 365. In the Microsoft 365 Exchange admin center, go to Mail flow → Rules. Click Add a rule, and then select Create a new rule. The New transport rule window appears. Give the rule a descriptive name. Under Apply this rule if, select The message headers... and includes any of these words. Click Enter text, paste the header key previously copied from the Trend Vision One console, and click Save. Click Enter words, paste the header value previously copied from the Trend Vision One console, then click Add and Save. Note You may need to update the header value from time to time. Under Do the following, select Modify the message properties and set the spam confidence level (SCL). Click the displayed SCL level, select Bypass spam filtering in the window that appears, and click Save. Add a new action by clicking the add icon (+). Select Modify the message properties and set a message header. Click the first Enter text link, type X-MSExchange-Organization-BypassClutter, and click Save. Click the second Enter text link, type true, and click Save. Review the rule settings and click Save. The new rule may take some time to propagate. Test the rule by setting up a test phishing simulation with a small group of recipients to ensure users can receive the simulation emails. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated.
