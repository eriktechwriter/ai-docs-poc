/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ User View details of user profiles in order to review type, status, and privilege information. The User tab allows you to view details of all human user accounts in your organization. Human user accounts may be members or guests in your identity provider, and they may obtain access from either inside or outside of your organization. Some human user accounts may not have a configured user type. If you have sufficient permissions, you may configure a user type in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. For more information, see Microsoft's documentation. The following table details the columns on the User tab. Column name Description User name Name of a user in your organization. User principal name An Internet-style login name for a user. A UPN consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (a DNS domain name) joined by the "@" symbol.
