 Application Control Application Control provides you with the ability to control which users have access to specific applications on certain endpoints. You have the option of creating an overall endpoint-based policy or, if integrated with Active Directory, very granular user-based policies per endpoint. After determining the scope of the policy, you can create application matching criteria that define which applications to allow, block, or monitor. For experienced users, you can create Lockdown criteria that only allow trusted applications to execute and block all applications not explicitly allowed by the rules.
