/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Exposure Overview Learn about the information available in Exposure Overview within Cyber Risk Overview. Exposure Overview displays your company's average exposure risk level and corresponding risk score for the category over the last 30 days. The exposure score is calculated using the weight of each exposure-related risk factor and the corresponding risk events in your environment along with the potential impact if the detected issues are exploited. Time-critical vulnerabilities are given greater weight in the calculation. Important The exposure risk level is calculated using all data received from your business without applying asset visibility scope limits. For customers with Vulnerability Assessment enabled, the Vulnerabilities tab in Exposure Overview displays: Time-critical security alerts: Alerts related to detected vulnerabilities on Windows or Linux devices that might indicate an ongoing zero-day attack, or high-profile N-day vulnerabilities that Trend Micro recommends you address immediately to bolster your security posture. The primary criteria for issuing a time-critical security alert include the potential impact, whether the vulnerability is highly likely to be exploited, and whether exploit code is publicly available. Zero-day or high-profile vulnerabilities are detected in part using Advanced Risk Telemetry enabled on your endpoints. To learn more about a highlighted vulnerability, including affected operating systems, available attack prevention/detection rules, and recommended mitigation or remediation options, click View details in the security alert. Trend Micro only issues time-critical security alerts for vulnerabilities with available mitigation options. You may create a new case for the vulnerability or add the vulnerability to an existing case by clicking the options icon () in the vulnerability entry. Important Not all remediation or mitigation options are available for all supported operating systems. If automatic mitigation detection is unavailable, mitigated devices may still remain on the affected devices list after mitigation is complete. For high-profile N-day vulnerabilities, you can view a summary including: The number of assessed devices in your environment How many assessed devices are affected by the vulnerability How many endpoints have been the target of exploit attempts related to the vulnerability Vulnerabilities widgets: Widgets displaying metrics about your current exposure risk and vulnerability management status as they relate to different asset types in your organization. Vulnerability widgets are available for the following supported asset types: Internal assets Internet-facing assets Containers Cloud VMs Serverless functions The following tables detail the vulnerabilities widgets available on the tab corresponding to each asset type. Internal Assets Widget Description Vulnerability Assessment Coverage The percentage of supported endpoints on your network that have an endpoint agent or a third-party data service enabled compared to the estimated total of endpoints in your organization Tip Increase your deployment of endpoint agents to at least 80% for better results. Click Extend Assessment Scope to configure endpoint data sources. Click View Devices to identify devices with no assessment visibility and troubleshoot issues. Click Configure CVE Coverage to select whether to assess for all CVEs or high-impact and medium-impact CVEs only. Note This feature is not available in all regions. Detected Vulnerabilities The number of unique CVEs detected in your environment, organized by CVE impact score High impact score: 70 to 100 Medium impact score: 31 to 69 Low impact score: 0 to 30 Click View Details to go to Threat and Exposure Management â†’ Vulnerabilities and see detailed information about CVEs detected in your environment, including individual CVE impact scores, impact scope, and related exploit attempts. Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) The average time taken to apply critical patches on all managed endpoints running a supported Windows operating system The Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) widget applies only to supported Windows platforms and major patch releases. You should carefully examine the MTTP data in conjunction with the Averaged Unpatched Time (AUT) data to better mitigate vulnerabilities on your network. Click View Details to view detailed information about devices with MTTP data in Threat and Exposure Management. For more information, see Mean time to patch (MTTP) and average unpatched time (AUT). Tip You can also add the MTTP widget to your custom dashboard in Dashboards. Average Unpatched Time The average length of time that endpoints with CVEs remain unpatched to the current date. The Average Unpatched Time widget applies only to supported Windows platforms and major patch releases. You should carefully examine the MTTP data in conjunction with the Averaged Unpatched Time data to better remediate vulnerabilities on your network. Click View Details to view detailed information about device average unpatched time in Threat and Exposure Management. For more information, see Mean time to patch (MTTP) and average unpatched time (AUT). Tip You can also add the AUT widget to your custom dashboard in Dashboards. Vulnerable Endpoint Percentage The percentage of endpoints in your environment supporting Vulnerability Assessment that contain CVEs The Vulnerable Endpoint Percentage widget applies to all endpoints with Vulnerability Assessment. Click View Details to view detailed information about vulnerable endpoints in Threat and Exposure Management. For more information, see Vulnerability percentages and CVE density. CVE Density The total number of detected CVEs divided by the total number of endpoints with Vulnerability Assessment The density calculation includes operating system and application CVEs. Click View Details to view detailed information about CVE density in Threat and Exposure Management. The CVE Density and Vulnerable Endpoint Percentage widgets work together to help you tailor your response to endpoint vulnerabilities. For more information, see Vulnerability percentages and CVE density. Devices With Legacy Operating Systems Devices that run operating system versions that have already reached End of Life (EOL) Devices running legacy operating systems are more vulnerable to attack as no new security patches are available for newly identified CVEs. Click View Details to view detailed information about devices with legacy operating systems in Threat and Exposure Management. Important Widgets in the Internal Assets tab of the Vulnerabilities section only show data for endpoints within the asset visibility scope of the current user. Internet-facing Assets Widget Description Detected Vulnerabilities The number of unique CVEs detected in your internet-facing assets Host vulnerability metrics currently only include high-impact and medium-impact CVEs. Vulnerable Host Percentage The percentage of hosts with CVEs The Vulnerable Host Percentage is calculated from the total number of hosts with CVEs divided by the total number of supported hosts. CVE Density of Hosts The total number of detected CVEs divided by the total number of hosts with Vulnerability Assessment The CVE Density of Hosts is calculated from the total number of detected CVEs divided by the total number of hosts (Total CVEs / Total hosts). The density calculation includes application CVEs. The CVE Density of Hosts and Vulnerable Host Percentage work together to help you tailor your response to host vulnerabilities. Containers Widget Description Detected Vulnerabilities in Container Clusters The number of CVEs detected in your container clusters Tip Click Extend Assessment Scope and add Kubernetes clusters with Runtime Scanning enabled or cloud accounts with Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection enabled in order to get better visibility into container asset vulnerabilities. For more information, see Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection and Runtime Scanning. Vulnerable Container Cluster Percentage The percentage of container clusters with CVEs The Vulnerable Container Cluster Percentage widget is calculated by dividing the total number of container clusters with CVEs by the total number of supported container clusters. The Vulnerable Container Cluster Percentage widget helps you tailor your response to container vulnerabilities. Detected Vulnerabilities in Container Images The number of CVEs detected in your container images Vulnerable Container Image Percentage The percentage of container images with CVEs The Vulnerable Container Image Percentage widget is calculated by dividing the total number of container images with CVEs by the total number of supported container images.
