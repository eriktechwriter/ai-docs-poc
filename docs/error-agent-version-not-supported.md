 Error: Agent version not supported The error message "Agent version not supported" indicates that the agent version currently installed on the computer is not supported by Server & Workload Protection. Although the unsupported agent will still protect the computer based on the last policy settings it received from Server & Workload Protection, we recommend that you upgrade the agent so that you can react quickly to the latest threats.
