# Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up the AI-centric docs-as-code environment on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required Software

- **Node.js 18+**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- **VS Code**: Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Recommended Tools

- **GitHub CLI**: For seamless Git operations
- **Docker**: For containerized development (optional)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trendmicro/ai-docs-poc.git
cd ai-docs-poc
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including:
- Docusaurus 3.x with MDX support
- AI integration libraries
- Development and quality tools

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading enabled.

## VS Code Setup

### 1. Install Recommended Extensions

When you open the project in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install recommended extensions. Click **Install All** to get:

- **MDX Support**: Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for MDX files
- **AI Assistance**: GitHub Copilot and Continue for AI-powered writing
- **Quality Tools**: Spell checking, linting, and formatting
- **Git Integration**: Enhanced Git workflows and collaboration

### 2. Configure AI Assistant

#### GitHub Copilot Setup

1. Sign in to GitHub Copilot in VS Code
2. Accept the terms and conditions
3. Verify Copilot is working by opening an MDX file and typing comments

#### Continue AI Setup (Optional)

1. Install the Continue extension
2. Configure your preferred AI model (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
3. Set up API keys in the Continue configuration

### 3. Verify Installation

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and run:

```bash
npm run quality:check
```

This will verify that all tools are working correctly.

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# AI Service Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# GitHub Integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Development Settings
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

### VS Code Workspace Settings

The project includes optimized VS Code settings for technical writing:

- **Word wrap** enabled for better readability
- **Auto-save** configured for seamless workflow
- **Spell checking** with technical terminology
- **Live preview** integration
- **AI assistance** enabled for MDX files

## Verification

### Test the Installation

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Verify hot reloading** by editing `docs/intro.mdx`

4. **Test AI assistance** by creating a new MDX file and using Copilot

### Run Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run quality:check

# Individual checks
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Node.js Version Mismatch

If you encounter build errors, verify your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

Ensure you're using Node.js 18 or higher.

#### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is busy, Docusaurus will automatically use the next available port. Check the terminal output for the actual URL.

#### Extension Installation Issues

If VS Code extensions fail to install:

1. Open the Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search for each recommended extension manually
3. Install them one by one

#### AI Assistant Not Working

1. Verify your API keys are correctly set in `.env.local`
2. Check that GitHub Copilot is properly authenticated
3. Restart VS Code after configuration changes

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the project documentation for troubleshooting tips
2. Review the VS Code configuration in the `.vscode` directory
3. Open an issue on the GitHub repository

## Next Steps

Once installation is complete:

1. **Configure your environment** - Customize settings for your workflow (documentation coming in later tasks)
2. **Take your first steps** - Learn the basic workflows (documentation coming in later tasks)
3. **Explore AI features** - Discover AI-powered capabilities (documentation coming in later tasks)

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **RAM**: 8GB (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **CPU**: Dual-core processor
- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux

### Recommended Specifications

- **RAM**: 16GB or more
- **Storage**: SSD with 5GB+ free space
- **CPU**: Quad-core processor
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for AI services

The AI-enhanced features work best with higher-end hardware, especially when processing large documentation sets.
