/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Support for multiple custom filters in a custom model October 16, 2023—The Detection Model Management app has been updated to support multiple custom filters in a custom model, with a maximum limit of five custom filters per model. Users can configure the Workbench to trigger an alert based on two more criteria: when events defined by the custom filters occur, or when events defined by the custom filters occur in the specified order.
