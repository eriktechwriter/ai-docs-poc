/*<![CDATA[*/ $('#title').html($('meta[name=map-description]').attr('content')); /*]]>*/ Keywords Keywords are special words or phrases. You can add related keywords to a keyword list to identify specific types of data. For example, "prognosis", "blood type", "vaccination", and "physician" are keywords that may appear in a medical certificate. If you want to prevent the transmission of medical certificate files, you can use these keywords in a DLP policy and then configure Data Loss Prevention to block files containing these keywords. Commonly used words can be combined to form meaningful keywords. For example, "end", "read", "if", and "at" can be combined to form keywords found in source codes, such as "END-IF", "END-READ", and "AT END". You can use predefined and customized keyword lists.
