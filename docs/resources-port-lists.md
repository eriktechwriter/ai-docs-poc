 Port Lists Configure port lists to manage which ports Web Reputation and Firewall rules monitor. Important If you are working on a policy, make sure to save your settings before leaving the screen. Leaving the screen without saving discards any changes. Port lists are a policy resource used by Web Reputation and Firewall rules to define which ports you want to monitor. You can add up to 250 port lists. Procedure Go to Endpoint Security → Endpoint Security Configuration → Policy Resources → Port Lists. Create or edit a list. To create a new list, click Add port list. To edit an existing list, click the list name and go to General Specify a name and description for the list. For Port, specify a port or port range. Ports must be a numeric value between 0 and 65535. Use a hyphen (-) to define a range. To add more ports, click Add. You can specify up to 20 items per list. Important Ports and port ranges cannot overlap. For example, specifying 0-120 and 90 is invalid. Click Save. © 2025 Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.Search Knowledge Base
