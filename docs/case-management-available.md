Case Management enables you to assign priority and ownership to cases containing both individual and correlated alerts from Workbench, and streamlines the start of your threat investigation and incident response workflows. You can open cases directly from Workbench alerts or with any XDR playbook in Security Playbooks. In Forensics, you can use an existing case to automatically pull impacted endpoints into the related workspace. In addition, Case Viewer allows you to manage your cases while working in other apps.
